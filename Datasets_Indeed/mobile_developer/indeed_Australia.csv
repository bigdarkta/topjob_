   Oh, and by the way:
 

   At REA we value diversity and inclusion in all forms. Gender, religion, ethnicity, LBTGIQ+, neurodiversity and so much more. Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you've got the must-haves, dedication and enthusiasm to learn but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.

Here at Luxury Escapes, our mission is to delight our customers with incredible deals for the world's best holidays.
 Unlike most travel companies, we’ve been investing in our tech and our teams while the rest of the travel industry has done the opposite. We had been saying “it’s a funny time for a travel company to be hiring” – but that’s no longer true. Travel is bouncing back in a big way.
 As customers return to travel with new habits, the industry is re-shaping itself, and a lot of business will move online. At Luxury Escapes, we want to take advantage of that shift. So, we are building new teams to help us deliver some very exciting projects, which we will tell you all about once you apply!

 As a Senior Mobile Engineer here at Luxury Escapes you will be responsible for the delivery of features and enhancements relating to the Luxury Escapes mobile platform. We're part way through a complete re-build of both our iOS and Android apps, so it's an exciting time to be in the mobile team.
 We're agile, so we have daily stand ups, autonomous teams, and developers deploy to production many times every day. We have a flat, collaborative structure both within and between teams.
 We are operating a hybrid working model (collaboration is at the heart of everything we do) so you'll split your time in the office and a home. 
Employee experience is king here, with weekly events, monthly recognition programs and significant professional development opportunities. (We have won awards for it – but the HR team don’t like to brag much!)
 Relevant skills:

 Swift, Swift and Swift!
 Reactive Programming (ReactiveSwift, RxSwift or Combine)
 Experience with SwiftUI and Combine
 Automated testing and continuous integration
 High level of attention to detail and a passion for problem solving
 Strong self-motivation
 Good communication skills
 A genuine passion for seeing our customers enjoying their escapes.
 Nice to have: Android experience (we use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!) or Node.js

 Benefits:

 Excellent Remuneration package
 20% Discount on Luxury Holidays and Experiences

Embedded Electronic and Firmware Engineer/Developer,Smart Guide,Port Melbourne VIC,"
We are an innovation company that integrates and develops world first software, hardware and electronic engineering solutions that didn't exist before we imagined them. 
We are constantly pushing the boundary of what technology can do and how it can be applied to relevant, meaningful, real-world problems in order to create solutions that help people, create a really positive user experience and serve to make a genuine difference. We typically take projects from concept all the way to design, development, manufacturing, sales, support and maintenance thereafter. Although we are best known for our iconic displays at Melbourne's tram stops, we also work on a variety of projects behind the scenes (most of which are not on our website) and include: 

Indoor and outdoor asset tracking and navigation 
Health and Safety systems 
Commercial office solutions 
IoT technology 
Wireless communications systems 
Web and mobile apps 

which integrate a wide range of technologies: 

Embedded microcontrollers and chipsets 
Display technologies (LCD, e-ink, etc.) 
Face recognition and biometrics 
Human radar systems 
Cloud storage 
Browser-based communication and visualisation tools 
Operating system (Linux-based) builds 
Various wireless communication technologies including long range RF and cellular 

We are currently looking to expand our small development team with an equally creative, easy-going individual who has excellent problem solving skills, loves a technical challenge and is passionate about their work. 
The Role 
 The work itself is broad and ideally suits an individual who enjoys a variety of challenging technical development tasks. Candidates must demonstrate proficiency in the following areas: 

Digital circuit design - designing a digital circuit centred around a modern microcontroller (ESP32, STM32, etc.), potentially with discrete supporting circuits connected with peripherals such as I2C, SPI, UART, etc. The design may need to be optimised for low power to suit a long-term, battery powered deployment 
Discrete analogue circuit design - including FETs, transistors, op amps, etc. 
Variety of chipsets - reading and understanding datasheets for various chipsets, researching and selecting the most appropriate and designing into a circuit 
Firmware development - writing and maintaining complex firmware for an embedded microcontroller, including managing peripherals, communications protocols (LoRa, BLE, WiFi, Bluetooth, TCP/IP stack, GPS, 4G, NB-IoT), remote firmware updates, ultra low power sleep modes, etc. 
RF Design - antenna selection and tuning, suitable layouts and other RF characteristics 
Switching and power circuit design - low-voltage switching (buck/boost) power supplies for embedded circuits, taking into account efficiency, electrical noise (EMI), ripple, thermal impact, component selection, solar-powered equipment and energy harvesting 
Mechanics and physics - an excellent understanding of physics and mechanical design, including thermal, structural, vibration, power, mathematics, etc. 
Lateral thinking - since we are an innovation company, we highly value people's ability to question the conventional direction and to come up with left-field, out-of-the-box solutions involving emerging technologies and a novel approach 

Proficiency for the above can be demonstrated either through work experience, personal projects or a strong technical aptitude in similar areas. 
The role involves working on multiple projects/products/solutions over time, each having many unique characteristics and requiring a combination of R&D and sound engineering principles. Applicants must be comfortable with learning and adapting to new technical environments, components and architectures. 
We provide as much opportunity as possible for developers to work in different technical areas over time, according to his/her interests, with mentoring from peers and constant on-the-job learning. SmartGuide is an equal opportunity employer, focused on supporting our staff, which we see as our greatest assets. We are strong and passionate believers in diversity, gender equality and a flexible environment to ensure the best work/life balance, especially for those with young children.

 Flexible working environment
 Support to help with development (courses, learning, development)






If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

How we work



 MILKRUN leaders know what goes into building something magical. Our experience scaling teams at Koala, Deliveroo, Dollar Shave Club, Canva, Amazon, THE ICONIC, SafetyCulture, and Shippit taught us a few valuable lessons.
  


 For starters, people do their best work when they are trusted to make decisions and supported when they make a mistake. We know creating an environment of authenticity and safety means teams focus more on solving meaningful problems and less on masking who they are. We know when you give people ownership and throw equity in the mix you create a flurry of motivation and high-performance. We know first hand how easy it can be to burn out when you’re in the build phase. Mental health and sustainable growth are a daily conversation.
  


 Things happen quickly at MILKRUN. Our pace of working is reflective of our promise to make super speedy deliveries to our customers. Our growth plans are scary big, in a good way. Our investors have some of the deepest pockets in Australia. Want to build something from the ground up with us?
