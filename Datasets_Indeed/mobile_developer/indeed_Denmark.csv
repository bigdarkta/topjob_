Do not contact us if you offer development services of any sort since we only hire directly.
The ideal candidate will be part of a team of 18 transitioning aggressively from pre-launch prototype to a commercial product.
We ultimately work on a solution that can solve world hunger and we need partner that are passionate and committed to such hard journey.
Core to that journey is our belief that engineers make reality out of dreams. We are inspired by the engineering quality and principles of companies like Tesla and SpaceX, specially the focus on obsessive focus, first principles and the power of manufacturing as a driver of innovation in engineering. Although we expect to build our company's culture, we believe it will be aligned with those principles (and ambition).
If you are a student (or about to be one), we offer you:

Unpaid internship during the summer (local or remote)


16,000 kr. salary for a part-time job while you study (on top of that, you can benefit from 6,397kr per month from state-sponsored SU )


42,000 kr salary after graduation

This is likely 25% over standard. That is because we are looking for the top 2-5% quality available in Denmark. Ie, we are looking for high performance, high potential candidates that can help us scaling fast from pre-launch while helping them realize their potential while studying and working in Denmark.
You will be fully responsible for building our 2 mobile apps, starting from the already existing API endpoints. The first app is basically composed of:

Marketing/promotional elements


Login and other access-related features


Scheduling of activities


App-baed ""remote control"" for our robot


Notification system


Operator actions

We are looking at someone that have experience and can execute on this project flawlessly and without major risk factors. The ideal candidate should have a good sense of aesthetics and should be able to develop without having designs, which may happen during the initial stage. Experience in web app development (backend or frontend is a nice plus).
We are strictly focused on folks willing to bring high performance and obsessive focus to our team. We want to treat you accordingly. You are willing to join a startup, and commit time to it success. You're good at making things happen against though deadlines and under strong individual goals. You're likely an engineer at heart when you address challenges and problems.

Company Description: 

Want to join Denmark’s best digital agency?
 For the past 9 years, MyImage has named us just that. Right now, we’re looking for YOU and your talents to grow our team and help Merkle get even better.

 Merkle is a leader in data-driven customer experience management (CXM), and we deliver unique, personalized customer experiences across channels and devices. We provide expertise in customer experience strategy and consulting, user experience design, CRM, data management, commerce, mobile, content management systems (CMS), adtech and martech platforms.
 We embody the strong combination of local and global: Almost 300 colleagues work here in central Copenhagen, but we are also part of Merkle worldwide and dentsu – a global agency network covering 145 markets.
 At Merkle, our mission is to help our clients provide their customers with the best experiences possible. More than anything, this requires skills, passion and cooperation.

(Senior) Game Developer,Rovio,København,"

  Situated in the heart of the city, Rovio Copenhagen is on a mission to create high quality mobile games that deliver lasting fun and great depth. We are a team of 20 experienced game developers in Copenhagen working on a new mobile game, and we are looking for a fifth programmer. Our programming team implements gameplay, tools, backend, rendering, UI, network and everything in between. Even though we are generalists and expect you to be too, we’d like to hear what your particular areas of expertise are.
 


 The most important thing is that you are skilled in the craft of programming video games - and that you can show us! We love seeing finished games, tools, toys or experiments, professional or otherwise. Additionally, we like programmers to have a knack for what makes a game feel great, and that they enjoy collaborating closely with all the other disciplines. We are building our current game in Unity using C#, Go and a few other languages, but if you haven't worked with any of those that's fine too. Good programmers can pick them up easily.
 


 As we are working on something new, we like to brainstorm together and spend most of our days in our office in the heart of Copenhagen and expect you to do the same. As you get comfortable with your tasks we can discuss what works best for you.
 
 What your days will look like:

 You will be writing quite a bit of code and supporting the game with anything from gameplay to UI components
 We will need your help to fix bugs, tune the game performance and optimise things that we have created
 You should be comfortable working on the prototype stage where a lot is constantly changing and not every good idea sees the light
 You will be working in close cooperation with the rest of the team to bring all the parts together
 Discussing obstacles, ideas, solutions, bugs, architecture and other types of knowledge sharing with the programming team

 Who we think will do great in this role:

 Solid programming skills
 Good understanding of what happens under the hood of a game and engine
 Good understanding of game design and a feel for great gameplay
 Ability to multi-task and adapt to change

 Would you like to develop not only cool solutions, but also yourself in an uplifting environment with fantastic benefits – then keep on reading!
 Merkle is a leader in data-driven customer experience management (CXM), and we deliver unique, personalized customer experiences across channels and devices. We provide expertise in customer experience strategy and consulting, user experience design, CRM, data management, commerce, mobile, content management systems (CMS), adtech, and martech platforms.
 We embody the strong combination of local and global: Almost 300 colleagues work here in central Copenhagen, but we are also part of Merkle worldwide and dentsu – a global agency network covering 145 markets.
 Smells like team spirit
 We don’t have a slide for fast travel between our two floors, but we have plenty of reasons why you’ll love working at Merkle. We offer:

 A nice pension scheme
 Health insurance
 Your own balance of office vs. remote work
 Weekly Friday bars (yup, your weekend buzz is on us!)
 Daily-cious breakfast and lunch from our in-house chefs

 Wine tasting club, running club, game nights, grand parties, fun events
 A creative environment that lets you think 27 kilometers outside the box

 We have employees who’ve stayed with us for 5, 10, 15, even 20 years! This is surely due – in part – to our flexible working conditions and consideration for each person’s needs. There’s room for you to be yourself, including dressing however you like. We try our best to take good care of each other, our clients, and the world around us.
 This also means we don’t hire brilliant jerks. Do you have a knack for pitching the right ideas, but have your head up your own amazingness? Well, for that reason, we’re out. More than likely, though, you’ll make an awesome addition to our team, and we can’t wait to meet you!

 We work primarily with .NET, Sitecore, Umbraco, and Episerver/Optimizely. As mentioned, this position focuses on Sitecore, but if you are more passionate about the other CMS-systems, then please do not hesitate to apply.
 We work with huge clients on all platforms and often with great complexity in the solutions. We work with architecture and integrations and help our clients both with recommendations on platform choices, integration options, and opportunities in relation to platform, products, and cloud offerings.
 We use and love Scrum, automation, Azure, Azure DevOps, cloud offerings, Visual studio, Resharper, headless architecture, integrations, GraphQL, SQL, JSON, CI/CD. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of tech and concepts we work with as these are ever changing.

 Understanding the ”as is” solution and architecting the ”to be” architecture
 Discussing options within the team and building the feature/product/architecture that was agreed upon

 In your professional team here at Meldahlsgade, you will meet your like-minded people – some of the best in the business. We work in teams with a lot of discussion and feedback across skills and disciplines, so you will never be left alone on a task.
 Check out two projects our developers are very proud of here and here.
 Developing yourself along with your projects
 At Merkle, developing is not just something you will be doing on your projects. You will also continuously be developing your skills as we make sure you carry out new types of tasks based on the latest technologies and trends.
 You will not be working on the same boring internal system for an eternity. We stimulate the nerd in you by providing a diverse workday with lots of challenges to keep your developer spirit alive and thriving.
 We even have a specific set of objectives to help you build more experience and climb the career ladder faster. We are also passionate about real-world knowledge sharing in our team, discussing client issues, and learning from each other’s experiences.
