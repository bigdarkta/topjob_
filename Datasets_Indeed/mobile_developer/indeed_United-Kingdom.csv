Our graduate timeline









Months 1-2: Software engineering induction










Our new-starter training programme gets you up-to-speed with the skills you need to thrive as a professional digital engineer. You’ll get a grounding in coding, source control, modern technology stacks, and more. You’ll then form a team with your fellow graduates to develop a piece of software, typically for a not-for-profit organisation or to be used within Softwire. Under the guidance of experienced engineers, you’ll learn what it takes to deliver commercial-grade software.












Months 3-15: Working on client projects











With your first project complete, you’ll join one of our teams delivering a client project, usually in our offices but sometimes on a customer site. You’ll get plenty of support throughout, surrounded by helpful colleagues and industry experts to answer all your questions. And with continual peer review of your work, your software engineering skills will quickly rise to new levels.

Harry Cummings




Part of the 2008 cohort, Harry joined as a coder, before starting to oversee development teams as a technical lead. He then joined our Advisory division, where he’s now a lead consultant, helping customers shape their technical solutions and delivery processes.

iOS Developer - Mobile,Dyson,Bristol,"




We own and develop the Dyson Link Smart home app, which is at the forefront of Dyson's IoT experience. We are proud of what we have built so far; we have an App Store and Google Play rating of 4.5 and 4.3 stars respectively, we have more than 1 million active users worldwide and our IoT platform has over 3 million connected Dyson machines. We have huge ambition to grow this platform and as we connect more machines from more categories the challenge is significant.  Our Team: There are 5 app teams, located in the UK and Singapore, each with up to 6 mobile developers and 3 test automation engineers, plus a scrum master and product owner. We all come from a variety of educational backgrounds and experience levels; not all of us are computer science graduates. We believe that teams composed of people from diverse backgrounds are more successful and innovative.  Our teams have the autonomy to manage their own work using Scrum or Kanban frameworks, each honing their ways of working through regular retrospectives and knowledge sharing. We all share a commitment to creating high-quality code, and engineers choose to follow practices such as pair programming, mobbing, and test-driven development. We also regularly share our knowledge and interests peer-to-peer through ‘community meetings’, which have led to the adoption of new technologies and improved cross-team collaboration.  We often need to interact with people from different parts of the business, such as embedded software and the cloud teams, so we plan in 5-sprint ‘increments’, based on the best bits of the [1] Scaled Agile Framework. This gives us more visibility of upcoming work while remaining responsive, and allows us to collaborate effectively with other teams within our 11,000-person organisation.  Mutual trust and respect between team members is important to build a supportive environment where people can do their best work. Our teams understand themselves well enough to make decisions about how they work; everyone’s contribution is vital.  Besides being software professionals, we are also people who enjoy playing online or board games, heading out to lunchtime yoga classes, recording our latest run on Strava or just catching up over coffee. The last year has been a challenge, but we have maintained and strengthened our culture while working through the various lockdowns with virtual events, an informal team newsletter and an empathetic attitude to the needs of individuals.

 About the role
 We are on the lookout for iOS developers to join our mobile app team at Dyson. Communication, collaboration, self-evaluation and a desire to improve are second nature to you, and you value good engineering practises. You understand the need to deliver robust, testable code balanced against the need to deliver fast.  Our Tech:  Our iOS app is written in Swift, and uses the MVVM pattern with [1] Coordinators. We have multiple modules to separate functionality and reuse common code, managed along with our external dependencies using Cocoapods.  Since almost everything that happens within our app is asynchronous, we use [2] RxSwift extensively to capture, combine and manage event streams, and also to bind the UI layer.  We write our unit tests with XCTest and RxTest, and we use XCUITest for automated UI testing.  What you’ll be doing:

 Working with your fellow developers to contribute to features and improvements to our Dyson Link app, ensuring they are tested, robust and scalable
 Working with colleagues from other disciplines, including test engineers, product owners, Scrum Masters, UX/UI designers, and software engineers in our cloud and embedded teams
 Sharing knowledge within the app team to develop your skills and competencies and those of your teammates
 Identifying new technologies, tools and approaches to help continually improve standards and quality

Wise is one the fastest growing companies in Europe and we’re on a mission: to make money without borders the new normal. We’ve got 13 million customers across the globe and we’re growing. Fast.
 Current banking systems don't let us send, spend or receive money across borders easily. Or quickly. Or cheaply.
 So, we’re building a new one.
 And, we need a Java Developer to join our mission and help us build a global platform that’s scalable, reliable and secure. We’re working on lots of algorithmical challenges, and you’ll dive right into projects on reconciliation, integrations, authorisations and authentications.
 Money without borders – instant, convenient, transparent and eventually free. During the 10 years since our launch, we helped millions of customers, but there are customers who were suffering the most from the bank FX fees and needed new, better banking tools to manage their money internationally. To address this need we launched borderless account that is offering multi-country, cross-border banking in one app. Now we’re powering money for people and businesses: to pay, to get paid, to spend, in any currency, wherever you are, whatever you’re doing.
 The Wise card is a key part of the borderless proposition, it is responsible for the “spend” part of the general vision. Card issuing is the best way to let customers spend their money in the modern world, but we should keep in mind that real plastic cards are only one of a possible solution to spending problems. Tomorrow it could be virtual cards, apple and google pays, QR codes, mobile payments, or something else that is not yet invented. Our mission statement for the Spend and Wise tribe is: Give our customers reliable, easy to use and eventually free way to pay from borderless accounts everywhere in the world.
 What does it take?:

A strong product mindset and passion for user experience, you prioritise work with the customers in mind and make data-driven decisions to fix customer pain-points
Great communication skills and the ability to articulate complex, technical concepts to non-technical audience
Experience working with relational and non-relational databases, query optimisation and designing schemas
You enjoy writing testable code and believe in Test Driven Development
You have solid Java 8 plus knowledge, experience with Spring framework and database abstraction layers like Hibernate
You believe in and follow best coding practices, code reviews and open feedback
Experience with CI/CD pipelines and Distributed and Concurrent Systems
Hands on knowledge of system integration patterns

What does success look like?

You’ll have onboarded and found your place through understanding your team and tribe vision and how you can contribute
You’ll understand how our values can help you guide your work
You’ll understand the reasons behind problematic payments and customer difficulties and how to go about solving them
You’ll be raising the automation level to enable scaling of the product 
Understand our customers and the impact our product makes in their lives
You’ll help us scale-up and build a world class money transfer product by finding solutions to our technical challenges and opportunities

What you get back:

The autonomy to solve problems your way 
The freedom to have real impact 
Loads of development opportunities 
A fun work environment with social activities and events
The opportunity to work with super smart people

Junior Android Developer,Octopus Energy,Remote in London,"


Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.
  


 We invented, designed and built Kraken Technologies to ensure that we had the most innovative, data-centric and customer-focused technology to support our top-class customer service. Kraken Technologies now delivers transformational Energy-Tech to businesses around the world to make the global transition to green energy quicker and more affordable.
  


 We’re now licensing Kraken Technologies to businesses globally. You can read about our partnership with E.On HERE as an example to see how Kraken is evolving our business. You can learn more about how the migration works in practice HERE.
  


 Our aim is to have 100 million customers on the Kraken Platform by the year 2030.
  


 Our group includes Octopus Energy, Octopus for Business, Octopus Electric Vehicles and Octopus Energy Services as well as our new net zero Centre - Octopus Centre for Net Zero.
  


 We recently secured over £500 million of investment from Origin, Australia's largest Energy Company and Tokyo Gas, to help us continue our mission. This will help power our growth into new markets, invest in Kraken Technologies, build more tech to make energy greener and increase our investment in service and growth in our existing markets, the UK and Globally.
  


 Our Team
  

    We’re a newly established mobile team (we just passed our 1st birthday!) with a number of native mobile projects currently in development and we’re looking to rapidly expand the team.
  


 We’re building a team to work fluently, move fast and make a tangible difference in Energy tech. Our current projects span Electric Vehicles, Energy accounts, Smart home devices, Acquisitions and Engineer solutions.
  


 You’ll be working to solve problems at a global scale. You’ll help define culture and processes necessary to work collaboratively and effectively across multiple product teams, whilst instilling good engineering practices for the team as a whole.
  


 Our Technology
  

    Being a new team without the constraints of large legacy codebases has enabled us to make modern technology choices. All our apps are built with declarative UI (Jetpack Compose & SwiftUI), all our APIs are built in GraphQL, and we use a modern selection of libraries and software development techniques.
  


 We have projects in pure Android/Kotlin, others in pure iOS/Swift and we also use Kotlin Multiplatform in larger projects to share code between native codebases.
  


 New to Kotlin Multiplatform? This tech enables both iOS and Android developers to contribute to shared business logic written in Kotlin which compiles to native libraries for respective platforms (Java libraries in Android & frameworks/cocopods/spm packages in iOS). We encourage all developers to get involved in writing shared code, learn about other platforms, and contribute where they feel comfortable.
  


 This tech allows us to work as a unified mobile team, as opposed to having an iOS/Android divide, which we’ve found to be really exciting, opening up new opportunities to learn and collaborate.
  





 About you...


 You’ll be someone who thrives on uncertainty and loves to make an impact. 
You’ll be passionate about what you do and that shows through your enthusiasm and communication. 
Your values will align with that of the company’s, you’ll care about sustainability and creating a better future for our planet. 
You’ll enjoy contributing across the whole development process including design, product management and stay on top of upcoming technologies that could benefit the business.






What you'll have 


A computer science degree or equivalent (Not essential but desirable) 
Can demonstrate having built one Android app, as a hobby or as part of a degree
 Knowledge and experience with Kotlin
 Are keen to develop features across Android & iOS (previous exposure to iOS development is a plus, but not required)
 Are excited to learn new technologies like Jetpack Compose and GraphQL
 Passionate about great app design and user experience






Why else you'll love it here...


 Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
 Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people

   We’re looking for someone who thrives on solving tough problems. Someone who can challenge those around them, and be challenged, while delivering delightful experiences for our internal and external customers.
  



    If this sounds like a great opportunity but you are based outside of London, we are also open to remote working
  


 If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you. 




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic.

Senior Full Stack Developer,Dent Reality,Remote in London SE1,"

At the heart of our web platform is the map builder, which helps retailers to quickly map their stores.

 The role:
 Our mission is to bring rich digital experience to every indoor space - changing the way that people interact with the real world. An important part of that is creating self-serve setup tools that regular people can use to quickly map these spaces.
 The store map above would typically cost £100k's to produce, and take months of work by experts, using specialist tools. With the innovative work our web team has done so far, we've got this process down to 2 days. We're determined to make it 100x faster still.
 As a Full Stack Developer, you will work on our map editing tools, our portal user interface and our backend APIs. You will have a large input into the product experience, technical direction and the future of the platform, working with some of the worlds leading retailers.
 What do we do?
 With future wearable devices - currently being built by Apple, Meta and others - the real world will become filled with rich digital overlays of information. Much like in every sci-fi movie we’ve seen, this new technology will become as useful and dependable as the internet is today.  We’re building the technology layer which integrates with every location, allowing businesses to serve up these digital experiences for every visitor. Whether it’s in retail, or airports, or offices, or museums - our technology will power the next-generation of interaction.  We’re starting today on mobile, and in retail stores, where we can help people to find items in-store - with a map that knows where everything is, and by locating the user with the highest level of precision.

 How we work
 We've an innovation-driven company - we're building a high-calibre team, where each member is given the freedom to explore new ideas, and takes ownership over their own projects and initiatives.
 A part of our magic come from the integration of mapping, location technology and user experience. Collaboration across the team is key to making this happen - we want everyone to contribute and add value in all the ways they can.
 By promoting R&D, innovation and new ideas, and with open collaboration across each area of our business, our team is able to build things that haven't been done before, and aren't possible in most companies.
 What will you be doing?
 On a day to day basis you’ll be:

 Working with the team to identify solutions to complex problems in our web portal and API
Implementing features within our mapping solution to improve ease of use and overall experience
Understand and reason about wider web application concerns like design, performance, security, and CI/CD
