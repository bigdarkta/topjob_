Senior Mobile Developer,QVIK AB,Distans in 111 22 Stockholm,"
We are looking for talented senior software developers that understand self leadership, and are nice people. You are likely a startup minded person with a genuine interest to build something new. You are not afraid to be hands-on in the projects but also want to participate in decision making and shaping the future of Qvik in Sweden.
 The role will have opportunities to take part in decision making outside of the project work of our many awesome clients in Sweden, which includes some of the biggest digital entertainment companies and major payment service providers.
 Qvik is a consulting firm like no other. Operating in two countries, we are both a nimble startup here in Sweden and a big company in Finland. This means that we are free to operate as we want to, but still have the muscles of a big company when we need to. The Swedish offices started in August 2018. Qvik builds digital solutions with real, measurable value - and meanwhile we have lots of fun :)
 Qvik builds its employer image through being present in the developer communities and even creating new expert communities when needed.
 Qvik was established in 2009 with 8,6M€ (91M SEK) revenue, about 110 people in total, 9 people hired in Sweden (currently). The company is owned completely by its employees.
 We usually set up a remote office somewhere warm and sunny when things are dark and cold in the north (January - March). In 2018 we went to Phuket, Thailand and in 2019 Mauritius. It was canceled last year due to covid, but in 2022 we plan to go to Réunion.
 More about us: https://qvik.com/sweden/
 Requirements
 For mobile you need to have at least a couple of years with Swift or Kotlin experience, and preferably also some Objective-C or Java experience.
 No matter what you specialise in, you should be curious and interested in new technologies.
 Plusses
 Taking part in communities and public speaking is a huge plus for any candidate. Previous background in consulting is a plus. Any other programming experience or language skills is obviously a huge plus.
 Perks

 Competitive salary.
 Very good pension plan and assets management from a private healthcare facilitator
 Healthcare Insurance without need to go through public healthcare first.
 30 days vacation.
 Sports Allowance (friskvårdsbidrag).
 Company leased car / apartment, if chosen as part of salary.
 Always interesting and challenging projects.

Mobile Application Developer,Humblebee,Distans in 411 05 Göteborg,"
Are you ready to work at Sweden's outstanding digital product & service company?
 Why not join a workplace that gives you freedom, inspiration, incredible colleagues and a chance to work the way you want with projects you'll love.
 Maybe you saw this article on Medium and thought it sounded exactly like the place you'd like to spend your days?
 What we're looking for:
 As we are exploring the world of native apps we're looking for an experienced mobile application developer to join our team in Gothenburg. Maybe you are a web developer working on side projects in React Native or Flutter, or an experienced native app developer heavily into Swift or Kotlin. It doesn’t really matter. The most important thing is that you’re good at programming, and that you love developing great experiences and building what’s needed.
 Together with the team, you will work closely with current and new clients to create digital products and services. Your main focus at Humblebee will be the Javascript stack, and you should have good experience with frameworks like React Native.
 Our way of working
 Our work is naturally driven by UX and service design. We extend this notion when it comes to architecture and technical solutions by also being informed by domain-driven design meaning that our software should reflect the client’s business, not be just a technical-jargon construct. We prefer microservices rather than monoliths and love the cloud and the possibilities that it gives for creating performant, reliable and secure applications that can scale over time.
 What we would expect from you:

You're experienced in React Native and maybe also other frameworks like Flutter.
You might have some experience in Swift and/or Kotlin.
You love working with Javascript and Typescript.
You communicate via API:s, preferably Node.js and GraphQL
You're interested in technologies like Serverless architecture, Headless CMS etc.
You enjoy collaborating with a multi disciplinary, multi cultural team.
You experiment with new technologies.
You spread energy and inspire your team members.

You are as important as your skills
 We employ people as much for their human traits as their competence and skill sets. We like good humans around us. We work in a collaborative environment (design sprints, development sprints, workshops with clients etc) and therefore we employ people who are empathetic, kind, patient and gracious. We are Humblebee.

Does working on a project with many unknowns and huge potential discoveries sound exciting? Are you ready to stretch yourself exploring uncharted territories?

Drive mobile efforts to make sure the platform can run efficiently on mobile devices (Android) including adaptation of gameplay
Design and implement API:s, platform specifics, touch, resolution etc - basically cover all related to mobile that is built into our tech stack (Rust, own built engine)
Collaborate and work closely with fellow Creative play colleagues (UX, Design, Gameplay Engineers etc.)

 We would love if you have

 A background from both software engineering, and gameplay
Experience from building a game that runs on mobile
Strong will to learn Rust (Experience with Rust is meritorious!)
Senior full stack dev experience; you know how to build it, always with the user in mind.
Professional communication skills in English
The ability to be a great team player with good communication skills

 At Embark we offer competitive salaries, passionate colleagues to share knowledge with and much more, but most of all we invite you to take part of a journey into the unknown, to build creative, surprising and beautiful experiences together.  We welcome game makers of all sex, class, colour, age, gender identity, education, religion, opinion, culture, nation of origin, language, sexual orientation, shape, size, and ability.  Did we leave anyone out? Well, we welcome you, too! We think that the gaming industry is made better when everyone has a seat at the table.  Be yourself at Embark and make games while doing so. Please apply with confidence. We can’t wait to hear from you (in English)!  If this role doesn't quite match what you're looking for, feel free to apply to us via our ""Open Application.""

Full-Stack Developer in Uppsala,Prototyp,753 20 Uppsala,"
You have a few years of experience in coding, and you have a favorite stack, but you also enjoy learning new languages, tools, and frameworks. You believe in choosing the appropriate tool for the task. You want to spend your days where your technical creativity and love for stylish, efficient code are allowed to flourish.
 You keep it tidy and work agile. You're confident in your skills, but you're also open to learning from others, as well as letting others learn from you. Overtime is rarely needed because you and your team make a realistic plan from the start. This gives you peace and quiet, which increases the quality of your work and makes the job more fun. You build quality stuff, but you also know how to keep a deadline.
 You want to work on a little bit of everything, from web apps and mobile apps to VR and IoT. You love new tech and don't mind tackling a new platform by building early apps on a beta SDK.
 As a developer at Prototyp, you will often be in touch with clients, but talking about engineering solutions with non-engineers is not a problem for you. It's all about using good metaphors.
 Maybe you have an engineering degree, or maybe you did something other than study and learned a lot of things that are useful in work life? You are, however, an easygoing person who likes to get nerdy in lunch discussions about everything from obscure popular cultural references in video games to how to cook vegan gourmet food.
 At Prototyp we like to get our move on. We regularly go running, and walking meetings are a favorite. Everyone is entitled to one-and-a-half hours of paid workout time each week. Maybe that's not your thing? That's alright, too.
 On two occasions every year, we press pause on our regular projects and spend a weekend coming up with our own ideas. We then spend the following work-week building them. We call this our Prototyping Bootcamp, and it's one of the things that make our developers stand out from the crowd.
 Apart from working with really great colleagues on meaningful projects, you'll like working at Prototyp if you enjoy:

 Working in small, tight teams 
Delivering projects on time without crunching 
Video games 
Board games 
Listening to music 
Creating music 
Soldering stuff 
Dismantling pop culture theories using logic 
Blockchain humor

At Tengai we strongly believe that you can’t build next generation products with yesterday's tools, that’s why we promote curiosity and exploration when it comes to technology.
