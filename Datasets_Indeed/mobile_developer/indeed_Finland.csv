Mobile Developer,Circles Consulting,Helsinki,"
Hi! My name is Minna, and I’ve been working as a mobile developer at Circles for two years now. As we grow, we’re now looking for a brave and skilled senior mobile developer to join us at Circles, and take on the world together. Do you find yourself wishing you could play a part in development projects that matter, working with different business and challenges, whilst always having the support of your own team? If so, a career as a consultant at Circles would be the right choice for you.
 About the Role
 As a mobile developer you’d get to have a varied set of duties, ranging from setting up development environments to publishing the finalized application to the Play Store or App Store. Our customers often anticipate us to take charge and lead projects; a sign of the trust we convey.
 This does mean, however, that it’d be great to have the courage to speak up and carry the responsibility when needed.
 As a consultant you’d either be a part of the in-house team, or a consultant team, but always seen as an equal member of the team. As such, the duties of a consultant are multifaceted and ever changing, which is why adaptability really helps in this role. At times you could be choosing the tech stack used, or maybe packaging the application in its final stages. But variety is the spice of life, right? I find that what I really enjoy in my role is that I get to help businesses reach their goals while learning something new along the way.
 About You
 Kotlin and Swift are familiar to you, and you won’t scratch your head if you encounter Java or Objective-C either. You have an interest in emerging technologies, such as Flutter (which we also find interesting). Equally you make sure that your code is properly tested. The entirety of the mobile development process is something you know the ins and outs of, along with mobile architecture. An added bonus is a good knowledge of databases, and should you also find yourself to be a UX/UI champion, you’ll really be bringing it all to the table.
 In addition to your tech skills, we expect you to thrive on challenges and personal development, as these are areas which will be of importance in this role. You love solving problems and have an entrepreneurial mindset. We’re very much a community, and all we do is centered around a communal way of working, which is why it would be great if you like to do things together, and be a part of making decisions in regards to the future of the company.
 About Us
 Everything at Circles starts with an aspiration to be a great workplace. Circles is founded by experienced consultants, who have vast knowledge of the industry, so they understand exactly what it is like to work as a consultant. For us, it’s important that everyone gets a chance to work in projects which they are enthusiastic about, and you get a lion's share of the revenue that you bring in.
 Learn more about life at Circles here.

 Our top-notch devs (aka ""Rocket Scientists"" – the Finnish word rakettitiede means rocket science in English) work as consulting developers/architects in client assignments, typically at the client’s premises or remotely wherever they like. Our clients are mainly based in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but as long as your customer doesn’t have any preferences for where and when you should do your work, we don’t really care either.

We seek to provide you with challenging and attractive work opportunities and give you the chance to choose the projects you prefer.
 Your age, education, gender or any other irrelevant things do not matter to us as long as you’ve earned your spurs in software development and think before you code. Knowing how to open your mouth even outside the cafeteria is definitely a plus as well!
 With us, you get 50 % of your customer billing. Our pay is significantly higher than the average salaries in the industry – and you don’t have to work overtime to achieve it.
 In addition to interesting assignments and a hefty salary, we offer you a supportive and skilled group of colleagues. Discover who these people are by visiting our Marketplace – who knows, maybe you’ll be our next vict... resourc... rocket scientist, i.e. a smart and experienced software developer who wants to take on challenging assignments with great clients!

Software Developer with a Flair for Modern Maintenance,Vincit,Suomi,"Do you think that continuous software maintenance is a fascinating, inspiring and ever-developing field? Awesome, so do we! Vincit has understood the value of continuous services and software maintenance. We have turned our maintenance business, Vincit DevOps & Platform Services, into a strategic growth area, meaning we’re now focusing even more strongly on our talents, practices and, of course, clients. Are you a software developer with a flair for modern maintenance? If so, this is your time to shine!Okay, so what’s the job?In your work, you’ll be taking care of our clients’ digital assets, perfecting services and applications through continuous development and solving some of the more challenging problems the clients are bound to face from time to time. You’ll also get to be part of development projects from the get-go. This means being responsible for bringing any maintenance-related matters into focus already during the construction phase of the solution.We’ve got heaps of tech in need of support. Our main front-end technologies include JavaScript and TypeScript, React, Angular and Vue, whereas our back-end is dominated by Java/Kotlin, Node.js, C#/.NET and Python/Django. We expect you to know your way around at least one of these. Our code is AWS-, GCP- or Azure-based, depending on the need.Alright, but what is this “modern” of which you speak?When we say “modern”, we mean that you understand the value of continuous development. For you, DevOps isn’t only a bunch of letters but a way of building bridges between ‘dev’ and ‘ops’. When it comes to different technologies and methods, you want to develop your own skills. You often think about ways in which unnecessary tasks could be automated, and client value is at the heart of what you do.Do you believe that top experts – you included – are the best people to judge how to organize their work? Do you have a clear vision of how things should be done to prevent maintenance turning into a disposal site of last resort? If so, we are ready to offer you a golden opportunity that will allow you to get your hands dirty and change the way software is built today.Sounds good! Tell me about the team.The team’s got your back. Our community of continuous developers has grown to a crew of almost 50 people scattered across five different localities! We’re a diverse bunch: our team comprises software developers, mobile developers, WP gurus, DevOps talents, SysAdmins and service managers, all working side by side towards a common goal. Becoming part of this team also means becoming an important part of the Vincit ecosystem and a squad of more than 800 top professionals.You will learn a lot from your new colleagues, and in this case, saying you will “occupy a vantage position” is no exaggeration: your range of potential clients will be as broad as your data transmission bandwidth is wide. In the future, we will also be providing support to the clients of Vincit USA, which will give you an opportunity to expand your horizons internationally as well.Our everyday work is done in smaller teams, which are responsible for a limited number of clients and technologies – in other words, you won’t need to tend to our dozens of clients alone. To understand what we’re talking about, why not read our team SysAdmin Petri’s career story.Cool, but why should I choose Vincit?We’ve always emphasized continuous development, agility, individual freedom and making dreams come true – and we’re not planning to give up on any of these any time soon. We allow you to lead yourself and question the norms of work in a modern working environment. Click on the link if you want to learn how Vincit can offer you an excellent way to spend your waking hours and what we do to create a feel-good environment where working doesn’t feel like a pain in the backside.

Full Stack Developer,Rakettitiede Oy,Helsinki,"
Rakettitiede hosts developers with an impressive range of IT and Internet skills. Our daily grind consists of working with web and mobile services, IoT and embedded systems.
 We are looking for new crew members, that is, more first-class full stack developers for future client projects!
 Our top-notch devs (aka ""Rocket Scientists"" – the Finnish word rakettitiede means rocket science in English) work as consulting developers/architects in client assignments, typically at the client’s premises or remotely wherever they like. Our clients are mainly based in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but as long as your customer doesn’t have any preferences for where and when you should do your work, we don’t really care either.
 Our projects range from short spurts to continuous, several years lasting collaboration, and our clients range from startups to listed companies. There’s one common factor though: making the work interesting and challenging for our beloved developers. And, of course, provide opportunities for professional development.
 Since our clients hire our developers to solve demanding challenges, we expect you not only to have technical expertise but also to be enthusiastic about solving problems. And since we don’t consider you an anonymous resource, we won’t try to trick you with a ball pit or after work pints to draw your attention away from dreary client work. We seek to provide you with challenging and attractive work opportunities and give you the chance to choose the projects you prefer.
 Your age, education, gender or any other irrelevant things do not matter to us as long as you’ve earned your spurs in software development and think before you code. Knowing how to open your mouth even outside the cafeteria is definitely a plus as well!
 With us, you get 50 % of your customer billing. Our pay is significantly higher than the average salaries in the industry – and you don’t have to work overtime to achieve it.
 In addition to interesting assignments and a hefty salary, we offer you a supportive and skilled group of colleagues. Discover who these people are by visiting our Marketplace – who knows, maybe you’ll be our next vict... resourc... rocket scientist, i.e. a smart and experienced software developer who wants to take on challenging assignments with great clients!
 When it comes to full stack development, we’re familiar with keywords such as AWS, GCP, Azure, Firebase, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Windows, Java, Kotlin, Go, JavaScript, C#, Python, Clojure, Scala, Spring, Node.js, React, Angular and Vue.
 We provide

   ‍ 
  a supportive and skilled group of colleagues,
interesting, self-selected projects,
transparency and fairness instead of jargon,
some of the best salaries in the industry,
 comprehensive health insurance,
opportunity to choose your own tools,
lunch benefit, and
culture for adult taste.
