DevOps Engineer,Eficode,1150 København,"
At Eficode we have a collaborative culture and invest heavily in developing our people. We are currently looking to hire DevOps Engineers (consultants) to our Copenhagen and Aarhus offices.
 We're not just an IT consultancy. We focus on the technical side of Agile and Continuous Delivery - the art of delivering software quickly, safely, and sustainably. Our aim is to change the world by sharing our knowledge and building communities. 
As a DevOps Engineer, you will collaborate and consult with some of the leading businesses in Scandinavia. Our business model is not like your average resource consultancy, we pride ourselves on providing consultants with deep expertise as engineers, but who also come as part of a team.
 Skills and experience
 Our ideal candidate is someone who will actively seek answers and solutions to our customers' questions and challenges, then can communicate and implement them effectively. As an important part of supporting our customers, you will contribute to resolve problems, provide DevOps guidance relating to tooling, processes and ways to improve the development lifecycle.
 We expect you to have experience working in a professional and highly collaborative environment. In addition, you have programming skills, are fluent in English language, you like to work with other people and have an interest towards agile methods and new technologies. 
The below list of skills is wide-ranging and we are not expecting people to be expert with everything. We’re looking for skills in one or two of these areas, coupled with motivation and curiosity to learn some of the others. In each area the technologies listed should be seen as examples not exclusive requirements.

Containerization and Virtualization: you may be experienced configuring Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes, or possibly serverless architectures.
Commercial Cloud: you may have experience working with the services of at least one commercial cloud providers - AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud.
Automation: you may have set up build and deploy systems using Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitLab CI, ArgoCD or equivalent.
Version Control: you may be skilled in handling source code in git, using for instance GitLab, GitHub with artifacts in Nexus or Artifactory.
Software development: you may be skilled in one or multiple modern programming languages. TDD, DDD or other agile coding practices like pair and ensemble programming (earlier known as mob programming) are concepts you might be familiar with.
System Administration: you may be experienced at managing servers based on Linux, Windows or in the cloud with AWS, Azure or OpenStack.

The below list of activities shows what it takes to be effective at this position. We expect that you either have previous experience or you are interested in developing yourself by:

Defining problems for customers, proposing and implementing solutions while adapting to customer needs when it comes to technologies and ways of working.
Teaching technical skills, process, ways of working and DevOps thinking to customers.
Handling interactions with the team and the customer in a way that is transparent, pragmatic and motivated.

The suitable candidates will join one of our teams in Copenhagen or Aarhus. We have interesting and exciting customer assignments waiting for the right people, and a wealth of support and experience to draw on from the other Eficode offices across Europe.
 Your new team
 We are passionate about learning and we believe in our collaborative culture. At the Copenhagen and Aarhus offices we take for granted that you should be able to learn at work and to grow with your colleagues. To achieve this we aim for spending one day a week on ourselves, the team and on collaboration with other teams in the organization.
 We encourage employees to read books such as Getting Naked written by Patrick Lencioni and The Unicorn Project written by Gene Kim. If you don’t own a copy, no problem, you are free to use the office library or we will get you an audio version. 
Our employees go on to build great professional reputations. We want to give our people every opportunity to achieve their full potential, and to change the world along the way. Meet the Humans of Eficode here
 We are looking forward to your application! Please send your CV with a cover letter describing your achievements, why you would be a great candidate for the role and addition to the Copenhagen or Aarhus team via our recruitment platform. 
For more information about the role, please contact Sofus Albertsen for Copenhagen at sofus.albertsen@eficode.com or Mads Baggesen for Aarhus at mads.baggesen@eficode.com

Bliv softwareudvikler hos Atkins,Atkins,2300 København,"
Tag næste skridt i din karriere som softwareudvikler?
 Atkins udviklerteam består af IT-arkitekter, JAVA- og .Net-udviklere, projektledere, rådgivere og web-designere, som arbejder tæt sammen om at udvikle web-baserede løsninger af høj kvalitet. Typisk arbejder vi i mindre projektteams med udgangspunkt i en række forskellige spændende teknologier, og vi sammensætter den løsningsarkitektur, som vi vurderer, bedst opfylder det enkelte projekts behov. Vi lægger stor vægt på at være på forkant med udviklingen og tager gerne nye teknologier i brug.
 Som en del af udviklerteamet vil du være med til at skabe løsninger, som ofte vil blive anvendt af mange brugere, og hvor der er høje krav til ydeevne, stabilitet og brugervenlighed. Vi har erfaring med, hvad der skal til for at opnå dette, og vi vil supplere den viden, du allerede har med vores praktiske erfaring.
 Du har stor interesse for programmering og gerne i alle lag (full-stack). Du har naturlige evner for programmering og kan lide at sætte dig ind i nye teknologier. Desuden er du ansvars- og kvalitetsbevidst og trives i et arbejdsmiljø, hvor vi hjælper og lærer af hinanden.
 Hvis du erfaring med nedenstående eller lignende teknologier, vil vi gerne høre fra dig:

 HTML5 web-klient med Angular og Bootstrap med brug af responsive design-principper
 REST-services og forretningslogik implementeret i Java Spring
 ORM til database-tilgang via JPA/Hibernate
 Relationel database i PostgreSQL
 Drift under brug af Cloud og Cloud API’er i Amazon Cloud tjenester (AWS), MS Azure
 Udvikling med brug af Automatiseret tests, CI/CD, DevOps med eksempelvis Jenkins og Docker.

 Hvis du yderligere har arbejdet med GIS-udviklingsteknologier såsom openLayers, GeoServer, OGC (WMS, WFS), PostgreSQL/PostGIS og eventuelt har anvendt teknologierne i fagområder såsom vejsektoren så ses det som et yderligere plus, men er ikke en forudsætning.

 Gode karrieremuligheder og lærerige projekter
 På vores kontorer arbejder vi i åbne lokaler med direkte adgang til ledere og kolleger, og hver især har vi et stort ansvar for og indflydelse på vores egne arbejdsopgaver. Vi er gode til at identificere, hvad den enkelte medarbejder har af interesser og styrker, og vi sikrer, at dagligdagen netop bliver fyldt med de opgaver, der passer den enkelte bedst. I Atkins får du mulighed for at udvikle din karriere i et stærkt fagligt miljø, og du vil blive omgivet af kompetente og engagerede kolleger, som gerne lærer fra sig. Dagligdagen er præget af skiftende og varierende projekter, der også kan give adgang til internationale udfordringer.
 Vil du vide mere om jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte afdelingschef for GIS og IT i Atkins, Johan Hartnack, tlf.: 52 51 93 57.

Part-time Technical Consultant wanted,Omnidocs,1403 København,"
Do you love data and complex structures? Do you have a strong technical mindset? Can you balance a single focused task at a time and finish it before beginning the next one?

 Part-time Technical Consultant wanted We hope you identify with the three sentences above. Otherwise, you probably wouldn’t have continued reading this. You might already have gathered, that we need strong technical mindsets for a particularly complex data-oriented task. We are looking to put together a task force that will be working with this for a year or more. Afterwards there will be a place for you in Omnidocs for similar technical complex tasks. We can elaborate much more on this when we speak, but firstly a bit about us:
 Omnidocs is a consulting and software company based in Copenhagen – but more than anything we are a document company. We create value for our customers by helping them improve their use of Microsoft Office, creating and implementing on-brand solutions that fuel productivity, embed compliance, and increase job happiness. We have a wide range of competencies when it comes to documents in a work context, but our purpose is very straightforward: We make every workday work better.We have over 1,000 customers in 90 countries globally and more than 2 million knowledge workers use Omnidocs’ solutions and services.
  What’s the job about?

   Primarily it is about converting an older version of the platform called Templafy to the latest version. This involves analysis, transferring data to a new tenant (and adapting the structure), configuring any extra tools, and ensuring that everything works as intended. The job is also about communication and solving problems, understanding the process of the upgrade and overcoming obstacles, and adapting. Your tasks will have a wide range, but will primarily include:
  

Upgrading old versions of Templafy solutions (for live clients) to the latest called Templafy Hive
Understanding the old and new versions of the platform in full
Adhering to the established process, but also help to adapt and evolve it when you understand more about the inner workings
Collaborating with the rest of the task force and the program lead
Focusing on the task at hand, and only that task


 In the long run, your work will depend on your competencies and personal ambitions since we are a company that supports employees in their individual development. The quicker you learn and show us your skills the better the opportunities for you in the future. You can read more about the Templafy platform at www.templafy.com. We can explain more about our partnership with Templafy and our reseller role when we meet.


 Who are you?
 You are a person with a high level of technical understanding. You love data and you know how to structure data and can see the logic of complex systems. If you have some basic coding knowledge it will help a lot, as most of our software configuration is XML/JSON based. You are very meticulous. You have a natural interest in new technologies, and you are good at documenting your work. Also:
  

You are a fast learner, and only need to be shown/told things a few times before you can do it
You know your way around Windows and the Office suite
You understand how software works in general
You love data and complex tasks
You speak and write fluent English
If you are familiar with DevOps, Git, and basic HTML/XML/JSON it is a big plus



You are able to work approx. 15 hours per week

 Your education or educational background is not super important, and we are happy to receive applications from students or recent graduates as well as more experienced candidates. The most important thing is that you can see yourself, your competencies, and your interests in the above.
  What kind of company is Omnidocs? Our approach to how we work is closely aligned with our core values – take a look at our company values and our employer branding video on our career site https://omnidocs.com/about-us/careers/ and you’ll get a good idea of who we are.  We believe that work should be both fun, engaging, challenging, and meaningful – and then some! Helpful and understanding colleagues, small talk and friendly jokes, good coffee, and awesome lunch in beautiful surroundings are just some of the big extras you will find in a workplace like Omnidocs. We do social activities such as soccer, badminton, LAN parties, and Friday bars, just as we occasionally experience the world outside Omnidocs together. Most recently we have enjoyed a retreat on the Swedish west coast and in May we spent a couple of glorious days in the luxurious spa Hotel Marienlyst in Northern Sealand. Our office is newly renovated and located in the heart of the historic neighborhood Christianshavn, surrounded by canals and great little cafés and restaurants. We enjoy our lunch in the fabulous local Italian restaurant called Undici. We have plenty of light and air while being close to everything - including the metro, the canals, and the city center.

Please note: You can keep it simple! An application is not a writing contest, and half a page can easily be sufficient, just remember to include how you see YOU (interests and competencies) in this specific role.

DEVOPS ENGINEER TIL FREMTIDENS DATAPLATFORM,Energinet,Fredericia,"
DEVOPS ENGINEER TIL FREMTIDENS DATAPLATFORM 
Vi søger en dygtig kollega til vores dataplatform, der udvikles og vedligeholdes af vores Data Engineering-team. Teamet sikrer, at der etableres nye dataintegrationer og data-pipelines, så data bliver stillet til rådighed for både analytikere og it-løsninger.
Vi udvikler løsninger, der giver en bred tilgængelighed af vores vigtige råstof – data. Her skaber vi fundamentet for datadrevet beslutningstagning, innovation, udvikling og automatisering for hele Energinet. Det gør vi, fordi intelligent brug af data er et væsentligt fundament for at lykkes med den grønne omstilling, hvor informationsmængden og intelligensen i energisystemet øges markant.
I Energinet bliver du en del af en organisation, hvor trivsel og fleksibilitet står højt på dagsordenen. Du får derfor tilbudt udstyr til en god hjemmearbejdsplads for at kunne afveksle bedst muligt med at være på vores hovedkontor i Fredericia og hjemme.
DU ER MED TIL AT INTEGRERE NYE TEKNOLOGIER OG BYGGE LØSNINGER TIL KRITISKE PROCESSER
Du bliver del af et team, der har ansvaret for at sikre en stabil platform, samtidig med at den løbende får nye kapabiliteter. Vi arbejder på at implementere en Data Mesh baseret tilgang. Den nye generation af vores dataplatform er et helt centralt element i dette. Her bliver du involveret i at understøtte mange forskellige databehov på én platform. Det kræver høj grad af modularitet, og ikke mindst at overvågnings- og deployment-processer bliver automatiseret og effektiviseret.
Hvis du motiveres af at være med til at integrere nye teknologier og bygge løsninger, der er i centrum for kritiske processer, kan du sagtens være den perfekte kandidat. Som vores nye kollega får du nemlig en central rolle som DevOps Engineer, hvor du ikke bare skaber en effektiv platform i form af etablering af CI/CDpipelines, monitorering, logging, tracing og self-service. Du kommer også til at:

Rådgive dataengineers, der anvender platformen, så de rigtige moduler og framework anvendes, og med din erfaring som ballast, være med til at beslutte, hvilke komponenter, der kan indgå, og hvordan det anvendes i forhold tiloptimal drift og monitorering.
Designe, specificere og kvalitetssikre nye moduler til dataplatformen baseret på IaC, der udvikles af vores Cloud Center og Excellence-team
Bygge løsninger med modulerne.

Du kommer til at bringe dine evner i spil i forhold til at håndtere IoT og realtidsdata fra vores stationer i transmissionsnettet i en event-baseret arkitektur, ligesom sikkerhed omkring vores data er et fokusområde.
Dataplatformen er baseret på Azure-teknologistakken, og derfor får du indgående erfaring med state-of-the-art teknologier som Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse, Bimlflex (til ADF) m.m. En del af miljøet er på en Kubernetes platform, hvor vi både har vores eget-udviklede Energi Data Service løsning samt en open source-metadataplatform (LinkedIn Datahub).
DU BRÆNDER FOR DEVOPS OG DATA
Du har formentlig en videregående uddannelse inden for IT og softwareudvikling. Vigtigst er dog, at du brænder for DevOps og data. I denne rolle er det væsentligt, at du formår at tage ansvar og få bragt dine idéer og løsninger i spil i fællesskab med resten af teamet. Derfor er det vigtigt, at du fungerer godt i team-samarbejde, og har fokus på at skabe resultater sammen. Du har evnen til at knuse komplekse problemer og stiller gerne spørgsmålstegn ved processer, samtidig med at du har fokus på at lande løsningen.
ANSØGNING OG KONTAKT
Send blot dit cv via linket ”ansøg job”. Vi holder samtaler løbende og lukker rekrutteringen, når vi har fundet den rette kandidat. Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte Agile People Leader Michael Nielsen på 23 33 88 89 eller Product Owner Anders Knørr Lyseen på 61 96 27 70. Vi ser mangfoldighed som en styrke og opfordrer alle kvalificerede, uanset baggrund, til at søge jobbet. Vi arbejder aktivt og målrettet med mangfoldighed i Energinet og opfordrer dig derfor til at udelade billede, oplysninger om alder, civilstand og lignende, for at minimere ubevidste biases i processen.
SÆRLIGE FORHOLD
Jobbet kræver, at du kan opnå og opretholde sikkerhedsgodkendelse.


Energinet IT understøtter koncernen og koncernens forretningsenheder med it-udvikling og -drift. IT skal sikre, at Energinets forretningsprocesser understøttes effektivt og sikkert med informationsteknologi. Vi er et datterselskab i Energinet-koncernen, som varetager samfundets interesser, når Danmark skal forsynes med el og gas, og energisystemet omstilles til grøn energi. Vores kultur hænger tæt sammen med vores samfundsansvar, og vi arbejder aktivt med FN’s verdensmål omkring bæredygtig energi, klimaindsats, partnerskaber for handling samt industri, innovation og infrastruktur. Ved at vise vejen for grøn omstilling kan vi være med til at løse den globale klimaudfordring. Nye løsninger kræver, at vi evner at se problemstillinger fra mange vinkler, og derfor er mangfoldighed et nøgleord i vores kultur. Vi bestræber os på at lytte, involvere og dele vores viden. Med afsæt i værdierne mod og tillid lægger vi vægt på hele tiden at udvikle os som organisation og som mennesker. Læs mere på vores hjemmeside www.energinet.dk.

 Company Description
  About Tradeshift
 Tradeshift is a unicorn in the fintech industry. We are disrupting a typically stagnant environment by connecting companies of all sizes and providing them with the platform and network needed to create value from old processes like procurement, invoicing, payments, and workflow. We recognize that business is both messy and social - two revelations that have driven the development of Tradeshift, a platform for all your business interactions. We work hard and our teams have great freedom and responsibility to choose the best solutions, technologies and approaches to evolve the product to the next level.
 We believe that being a global, multicultural company is a tremendous strength and we have people working from 18 different countries with hubs in Bucharest, Copenhagen, Kuala Lumpur, and San Francisco. We believe that if we truly focus on how to work distributed and collaborate across locations and (home) offices, we will not only enjoy work more but also build better products for our customers, and ultimately be a better company.

 Impact how we build, test, operate and monitor our cloud-based products and services
 Participate in code reviews
 Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems
 Participate in on-call rotation for maintaining the platform

Når Java er meget mere end kaffe,SOS International,København,"Brænder du for at løse komplekse problemstillinger og udvikle skræddersyede applikationer, som gør en forskel på folks sundhed? Og er du typen, der trives i et nytænkende og dynamisk miljø?Så er du den helt rigtige for SOS International – en af Nordens førende assistanceorganisationer!Tak for din interesseHej, jeg hedder Alex, og jeg er afdelingsleder for Healthcare udviklingsafdelingen i København. Jeg kommer med en teknisk baggrund som IT-konsulent, og jeg brænder for agil softwareudvikling.Vores konstant voksende afdeling består i øjeblikket af 11 ligesindede, sjove og dedikerede medarbejdere, som bidrager til et favnende miljø med god kemi og højt til loftet. Vi har et rigtig godt agilt fundament med masser af opbakning, både i IT og forretningen. Men der er stadig meget, vi kan blive bedre til, og derfor vil vi gerne kontinuerligt udvikle os og vores måde at arbejde på for at få styrket vores kompetencer samt vores tekniske grundlag, så vi kan flytte os hurtigere, mere sikkert og mere stabilt.Stemmer dette værdisæt overens med dit eget, og tænker du, at jeg og mine kollegaer lyder som nogle fede mennesker, du godt kunne arbejde tæt sammen med, så læs endelig videre.StillingenDu vil blive en del af et Scrum team, der i øjeblikket rummer 4 erfarne og engagerede udviklere, som du kommer til at arbejde tæt sammen med. Derudover består teamet af repræsentanter fra forretningen og en Scrum Master. Du bliver en del af en selvkørende enhed, der har ansvaret for at holde vores centrale systemer kørende, med høj kvalitet og løbende værdiforøgelse. Derfor vil du også være med til at definere og udvikle Healthcare forretningens fremtidige digitale struktur. Afdelingen indgår i øvrigt i en ca. 90 mand stor IT-organisation, som hver dag arbejder for at udvikle, drifte og supportere hele SOS International, på det digitale område.Din primære arbejdsopgave vil være udvikling og vedligehold af de randsystemer og integrationer, der sammen med vores sagsbehandlingssystem udgør kernen i vores digitale portefølje. Systemerne anvendes til styring af sager indenfor fysiologi, psykologi og medicin i Norden. Systemerne håndterer mange tusind sager om året, med integration til både kunder og behandlere, og er derfor helt afgørende og central for vores Healthcare forretning.Sammen med teamet vil du være med til at sætte en retning for udviklingen og sikre, at systemerne kan blive ved med at understøtte forretningen i takt med, at nye behov opstår. I den forbindelse skal du sammen med teamet sørge for at prioritere teknikken lige så højt som forretningen, for at sikre, at platform og forretningsbehov følges ad.Hos SOS praktiserer vi en meget flad ledelsesstruktur, hvor vi gerne vil have, at den enkelte tager ansvar. Vi har en sund kultur med høj faglig stolthed, kombineret med et solidt samarbejde, hvor vi sammen gerne vil skabe de bedste og mest solide produkter.Der er en åben dialog, da det er motivationen der driver værket. Det er vigtigt for os, at den enkelte kollega trives, og at man har plads til at forbedre sig, samt at man indgår i fællesskabet. Fællesskabet er både teamet og afdelingen, men lige så meget også resten af virksomheden. Vi kan kun lykkes, hvis alle omkring os gør det samme.Om digVi forestiller os, at du:

Kan løse komplekse problemstillinger selvstændigt
Har stor forståelse for software- og systemarkitektur og formår at omsætte teori til praksis
Har en vindende personlighed og er dygtig til at samarbejde med både kollegaer og ledere.
Behersker engelsk på et godt niveau, da der tales engelsk på møder med internationale kollegaer

Derudover at du besidder flere af følgende tekniske færdigheder:

Solid erfaring med Java
Erfaring med Spring, Quarkus og lignende frameworks er ønskværdigt men ikke et krav
Database design (MS SQL Server, MySQL)
REST-tjenester
Source Control (Git),
CI/CD (Jenkins, Tekton, ArgoCD)
Containers (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift)

Vi kan tilbyde dig: 

Konkurrencedygtig og attraktiv lønpakke, der matcher dine kvalifikationer
Nye teknologier: Du har fx mulighed for at være med til at bygge løsninger på Red Hat OpenShift platformen
Samarbejde med DevOps teamet, og dermed tage del i driftsopsætningen
Løbende personlig og faglig udvikling
Stor åbenhed for input og sparring på tværs af afdelinger og ekspertiser, da vi er en forholdsvis flad organisation
Lækker frokostordning i kantinen
Attraktiv pensions- og sundhedsforsikringsordning
Sociale arrangementer, fx fredagsbar
