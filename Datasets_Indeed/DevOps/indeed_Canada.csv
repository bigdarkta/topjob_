Intermediate DevOps Engineer,Jane.app,Remote in Canada,"


   Jane is looking for a DevOps Engineer to join the Developer Foundations team in a missional, high-performance, hyper-growth company. In this role, you would have a chance to work on establishing and improving DevOps best practices, delivery excellence and quality support for the entire dev organization. In this high visibility job, you would be playing a critical role in helping us deliver high customer value faster with high quality and strong feedback. You would be partnered with other DevOp engineers and with your Dev Manager counterpart to drive the thought leadership and bring us to best-in-class SaaS operations.
  


 Like with all positions at Jane, this position is a remote position, allowing you to work anywhere you want across Canada. A happy, healthy and connected team is in the DNA of Jane and so even though we’re not a strict 9 to 5 environment, we’re working hard to ensure that you also have a life outside of work. We pride ourselves on flexibility & autonomy, and when it comes to decision-making, we take a decentralized approach ensuring that our teams' voices aren't just heard, but are acted upon. We're building something special at Jane, and we back that up with an employee stock option plan that ensures that everyone has a chance to share in Jane’s success.
  


 We really want the people who work at Jane to love being here, so it's important that we start off with a bit about what makes our company unique. Here are some specifics about what Jane is all about, and with these, hopefully, you have a better idea if this might be the kind of company you want to be part of.
  


 We’re a North Vancouver-born SaaS company with a distributed remote team across Canada, and our platform is modernizing the world of practice management software. We enable the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, secure video, and billing along with an evolving library of features.
  


 Tens of thousands of healthcare practices globally are now running on Jane. In 2021, we processed over 73 million patient appointments, and our scheduling application alone handles more than 10 million API calls per day. Jane is now the number one choice for Allied Healthcare practitioners in Canada. We’re growing quicker in the US than we were here in Canada 3 years ago, and we’re now helping run clinics in 44 countries.
  


 We’re profitable, product-led and growing organically to the point where 85% of our customer growth is either from customer referrals or word of mouth. Growth like this is unique, especially in the world of SaaS, and it doesn’t happen by chance. We have a brilliant team of over 250 employees who all do an amazing job of listening to our customers, building what they need, and providing industry-leading support.
  


 Last year alone we’ve grown our development team from 36 to 70, and the product team has doubled as a whole. 2022 is going to be a big year for Jane as we’re investing heavily into patient experience with our first patient-facing mobile app, enhancing our telehealth experience, building our own (J)analytics platform, working on global insurance integrations, and introducing new features like HIPAA compliant chat.
  


 Of course, it's not all about the numbers, but this puts into perspective the scale of Jane, from the thousands of practitioners whose lives are made easier each day to the millions of patients receiving treatment. If you’re the type of person excited by this growth, we’d love to speak with you.
  





 To be successful in this role...


 You have a strong background in SaaS and deeply understand DevOps, operations, infrastructure, and AWS.
 You have years of experience working with CI/CD software such as CircleCI, Atlassian Pipelines, and AWS CodePipeline.
 You are well versed in working in an Agile environment in a highly interrupt-driven team.
 You’ve supported teams who are responsible for the deployment, monitoring, and support of code running in production.
 You have successfully supported multiple teams who own their delivery and execute within a new mindset around DevOps culture.
 You are data-driven and know how to leverage tooling and data to help provide insights into operational effectiveness and to use those insights to communicate with executive teams and with the teams doing the day-to-day work.
 You have experience working with multiple software teams and know how to engage with the various disciplines to drive initiatives, gain buy-in from key stakeholders.
 You have built out dashboards that give developers important insights empowering them to be better

"DevOps Engineer, Platform",Alloy,"Remote in Vancouver, BC","About Alloy
At Alloy, we work with consumer goods companies that make the products we eat, wear, and use every day, as well as the ones we occasionally splurge on. We’re tackling a real and complex problem for them—managing supply and demand in the face of constantly changing customer behavior, highly complex supply chain networks, 40-year-old data standards and labor-intensive manual processes.
Alloy is a fast-growing, well-funded startup with an expanding presence across the world. Our team hails from successful startups, leading tech companies and Fortune 100 enterprises. We believe deeply in fostering individual ownership, iterating to excellence, focusing on what matters, communicating openly & respectfully, and supporting one another.
We encourage people of all backgrounds to apply. Alloy is committed to creating an inclusive culture, and we celebrate diversity of all kinds.
About the Role
Our DevOps Engineers are positioned at the crossroads of operations and feature development. They run our production systems, look for bottlenecks and weaknesses while maintaining a deep understanding of the services that run on them, and enjoy coming up with professional solutions that improve performance, security, and stability.
As a member of the development team, you’ll work with Alloy's other engineering teams to establish conventions, implement best practices, and improve performance in a DevOps mindset.
DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure on which Alloy runs. This means writing plenty of code and contributing to internal and external tools, integrations between systems, and the product itself.
For this role, a demonstrated basic understanding of data structures like graphs and trees is required, as you will work with them across our application. During the interview process, you will be asked to work with us on a coding challenge.
While we have a beautiful office in downtown Vancouver, this role is also available as a remote role within British Columbia or Ontario - whatever works the best to meet your needs!
In this role, you will: 

Design, analyze, and troubleshoot the fundament that Alloy is built on, and continue improving it.
Work on critical internal and externally-visible systems.
Scale systems sustainably and evolve them by pushing for reliability and velocity with Kubernetes on top of Google Cloud.
Manage our production, testing environments, CI/CD pipelines, disaster recovery strategy, etc.
Implement observability and security best practices in a SOC 2 compliant environment.
Write infrastructure as code with Terraform.
Engage with services before they go live and help setting them on the right path.
Isolate environments to make them more resilient. We accept that bugs will happen and prepare our systems accordingly.
Build developer tools that streamline our engineering workflows and empower the engineering team with our in-house built ""ore"" script suite.
Occasionally contribute code to the application if you see a chance to improve it.
Be loved by all departments for the magic you create. We know that if it works, it’s because you’ve done an excellent job.

You’ll be a great fit at Alloy if: 

You want to be appreciated and recognized for your work and not be another cog in the machine.
You know that the infrastructure must suit the product. You want to understand the domain so you can pick the right tool for the job.
You prefer managed services to self-hosted solutions where possible.
You care deeply about best practices for code quality, automation, and testing.
You have a genuine desire to help other engineers via mentorship, pairing, and code reviews. Our #eng-asking-for-a-friend channel has an average response time of under 15 minutes and is a blame-free environment.
You are a doer - when you see a problem that needs to be tackled, you deliver incrementally and plan ahead. You have an appetite for learning and embrace ambiguity; you don’t easily give up.
Asynchronous communication is second nature to you. You express complex ideas in an easy-to-understand and respectful manner - both in spoken and written language.
You have proficiency or familiarity with some of modern Java (or other JVM languages) or Python.
You have experience with cloud infrastructure providers, preferably Google Cloud Platform.
You have experience with Kubernetes and Terraform.

*There's a good chance we didn't get this right! Like with many other things in life, this job description is a work in progress. We'd love to hear from you and what would make you a great fit in our engineering team!
What you’ll get for joining: 

Base salary $89,000 - $136,000 CAD
Substantial equity package
Flexible vacation policy
Support from highly experienced mentors
Genuine and welcoming teammates
Comprehensive health coverage
Monthly team events
Fully stocked snack-shelf
Paid parental leave

Our engineering culture emphasizes code reviews, mentorship, and collaboration. We foster individual ownership of engineering work across the team and lean on each others' strengths when needed. We strive to write clean, extensible code that your colleagues love to read and keep the bug backlog in check. We focus heavily on promoting best practices for code quality, automation, and testing.
Technologies we use
Java 16+, PostgreSQL, Python 3, TypeScript, jOOQ, Dropwizard, AutoValue, Guava, React, Redux, Redis, SASS, Jest, Cypress, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Bigtable, PubSub, Kubernetes (GKE), Terraform, Containers (e.g. Docker), Bash/Zsh/Shell.
Our values
*Focus on what matters: * Reevaluate priorities as necessary to pick the work that will have the highest impact on the customer and business. Work hard in a way that is sustainable. Choose the schedule that lets you achieve your best. Measure results, not hours. Respect your time and that of others; come prepared and leave with commitments.
*Take ownership: * Take initiative by proactively identifying opportunities or issues and tackling them. Strive for excellence. Hold yourself and your colleagues to a high standard. Create something that makes you proud. Follow through on our commitments to customers, users, and each other. We are all doers, regardless of role — no task is beneath you.
*Iterate to excellence: * Prefer action over perfection to learn quickly from early feedback. Be flexible and accept the need to make tradeoffs and change directions. Everything is a work in progress, nothing is done. Question prevailing assumptions, but understand them first. Gather evidence and champion ideas that will make our products and our company better. Verify and validate.
*Communicate openly and respectfully: *Offer and expect transparency to build trust. Confirm mutual understanding, especially in the face of disagreement. Treat each other with respect. Criticize constructively — the work, not the person.
*Have each other’s back*: When interacting with each other, always assume good intentions. Trust each other and take risks together. Give praise generously and take joy in others’ accomplishments. Grow a diverse team by actively seeking different backgrounds and cultivating an inclusive culture. Focus on how others’ strengths compliment us, rather than how their weaknesses invalidate them.

DevOps Engineer (Software Developer for Infrastructure),Archon Systems Inc,"Remote in Toronto, ON","DevOps Engineer (Software Developer for Infrastructure)
What’s most important to you? A great place to work? A stable, successful company? Or making a meaningful impact?
How about all of the above?
We are a rapidly growing startup helping small businesses outcompete the giants; we improve their inventory management (an underappreciated problem!) with our powerful yet easy-to-use software and hardware.
We’ve been stable, bootstrapped and successful since 2007. We started by dominating the desktop inventory software market with over a million downloads, and transitioned to the cloud and mobile since 2017, opening up new technological possibilities and accelerating our business growth.
We do our absolute best to show respect and compassion to customers, employees, and job applicants, and people tell us that Archon is an amazing place to work. You can of course check us out on Glassdoor, our website, or what to expect when applying for a job.
We’ve got an amazing group of talented and friendly people here, and we’re looking for world-class talent, like you, to join us!
Hybrid work - one day/week in the office
We know that in the software industry, you can get most of your day-to-day work done outside of an office. We value the freedom and flexibility that comes from being able to work from home; in fact, we’ve been pioneers in mostly-working-from-home for over a decade, waaaay before it was cool.
We also believe that it’s important to be able to build real human connections (dare I say, friendships?) with your co-workers, and that there’s no substitute for in-person bonding time for this. These connections (friendships?) build trust and encourage open and honest conversations; they’re good for business AND good for well-being.
That’s why we require that employees work one day per week (typically) in our beautiful Toronto office, with this in-person time focused on team gatherings, monthly free lunches, and other activities that are best done in-person. Other days, you’re free to work from home, the office, or any productive environment.
