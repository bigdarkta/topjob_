 About the job


 Summary

      It is an exciting time in Home Office Digital Data and Technology; we have a number of great new initiatives coming together which are laying the basis for our future operating model –reshaping and truly redefining how we manage our delivery and services to citizens.
     
 This is a really great opportunity, you’ll be joining and supporting our development teams in picking up new work, supporting to build mature delivery pipelines in a multi-disciplinary team. You’ll be using a number of our cloud platforms (AWS focus, using native tools as well as our ACP and EBSA platforms) to enable rapid delivery, whilst working to our standards (must be secure, robust, accessible). As a DevOps Engineer you’ll work alongside our architects, technical leads and product leaders to ensure all of this is in place.
    


 Job description

 You will be responsible for maintaining and supporting our platforms. Your role is proactive, checking relevant metrics and performing platform updates when necessary. This will ensure it is accessible to users and has capacity for production and deployment. Upon request, you’ll also advise developers on how to use the platform effectively, reviewing and advising on their CI/CD pipelines, this may also involve working to deliver components of new platforms.  Whilst this is not a leadership role you’ll have the opportunity to support the build of the team around you, possibly mentoring others or being mentored yourself and getting hands on in recruitment activities.  To sweeten the offer, we’re one of the largest consumers of cloud services in the UK, and we make use of many vendors and technologies. We understand that continuous learning is extremely important to you as an engineer. To support you we will give you the materials and time to grow yourself. Additionally, you’ll have the support of a rapidly growing engineering community!
 You can also take a look at our recent blog post on DevOps within the Home Office - Home Office Digital - what are we doing in DevOps



 Responsibilities


       You will help design, expand and maintain our infrastructure, engaging with the rest of the team to arrive at solutions that help them perform better, deploying product updates, identifying production issues and implementing integrations that meet user needs.
      

Your main day to day will involve:



Writing scripts to deliver/work with our platforms, such as developing docker/terraform/ansible files for a variety of systems/frameworks.



Providing technical support functions, solving more challenging platform use and configuration issues.



Providing feedback to project teams on platform use; supporting routine monitoring activities.



Advising developers on how they should use existing systems and configure CI/CD pipelines.



Working on ways to automate and improve development and release processes.



Working with developers to ensure that development follows established processes and works as intended.

 Like most businesses we need to maintain our services 24/7, therefore, on occasion there may be a requirement to work out of hours, for which you will be paid.
     

 Essential Criteria

 We’re more interested in people who understand the methodology and fundamentals rather than specific tools. You’ll be ideal for this role if you have a demonstrable passion for automation and collaboration, with skills or experience in:
      


CI/CD tooling - ideally Jenkins, Bamboo, GitLab etc.



Cloud platforms - Ideally AWS



Container workloads and container orchestration frameworks (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS)

Networking and load balancing



Scripting (any of the following) - Bash, Perl, Python or Go

 We work at scale, and we have the tech stack to support this, delivering services to millions of people across the United Kingdom. If you want to be part of this, whether already working at this level or looking to make your next career move then we’d love to hear from you! You don’t have to know all the technologies but knowing one of the alternatives in most of the groups is good already!

    We have a fast and effective three-stage interview process. Stage one is a short phone screen, while stages two and three are both face-to-face interviews (using MS Teams or in-person). This allows candidates to meet with the hiring manager and other team members.
   




    We know that it can be challenging to interview while being employed so we try to be flexible on interview times.

Supporting the essential tools that enable the development process.
Continuing to enhance our on-premises services while we build out the future platforms in the cloud.

We expect you to become an expert within Platform Engineering, helping set the direction for at least one key area of the team’s work. We must develop the skills of all our engineers, so this role will expect you to provide guidance, coaching and mentoring to all members of the Platform Engineering group.

Take ownership of the delivery of specific stories or epics, including coordinating the work of others.
Work directly with the Product Owner to clarify and further define the details of how a story should be implemented or suggest alternative solutions.
Provide mentoring, coaching and guidance to other engineers in the squad.
Research and evaluate software products; create PoCs as necessary to demonstrate new ideas and technologies.
Diagnose and resolve problems with the platforms supported by Platform Engineering.
Identify and drive improvements in how the squad works.
Listen to teams across IT to understand how we can help improve the platform and share best practices to help development teams improve how they work.
Be an active participant in squad-level ceremonies.

A problem-solving mindset.
A passion for improving how we develop and run our applications.
The ability to prioritise and manage multiple workflows simultaneously.
Experience in working as part of a team and building strong working relationships.
