 Maintain relationships with internal and external stakeholders and of course AWS






Enough about us, let’s talk about you! You are someone with:


 A passion for Engineering who wants to join a team that values and rewards it
 A background in Site Reliability Engineering or Cloud managed services, ideally with a Vendor, consulting or professional services organisation.
 Demonstratable experience supporting AWS platforms 
A high level of competency across compute, storage, and networking in the Cloud
 Experience in commonly used Operating Systems either Linux or Microsoft Windows 
Good exposure to Lambdas, Containers, APIs, and other components of a modern AWS environment
 A sound understanding of SRE, DevSecOps, ITIL, ITSM, IT security and monitoring frameworks
 High level of understanding of disaster recovery, high availability, fail over and redundancy processes (and how they should be implemented and executed)
 Ability to demonstrate a sound understanding of modern AWS deployments – tools and technologies – so you can support and improve them
 Excellent communication skills with high attention to detail. Fluent English language (written and verbal) skills are a must. Any other language skills will be a bonus.






Next Steps



 If you have the drive and passion to succeed, apply now.

However, given the changing nature of the pandemic, we do reserve the right, following a Health & Safety Risk Assessment, to require that a role be performed by a person vaccinated against COVID-19 to minimise the health and safety risk to our people therefore ongoing collection of vaccination status will be important for managing future risks.

This project is ultimately a fully customisable data platform that will pave the way for the future of innovation in technology.

 What will you bring to the role?

Experience: As an Intermediate DevOps/Python/Javascript Developer, with a minimum of 3 year’s experience under your belt, you have gone through enough failures and successes in projects to make you technically stronger than many of your peers which is evident in the way you approach challenging problems – facing those in a health-tech environment is a major bonus!
Skills: Proficiency in infrastructure automation is a must, and experience with Ansible and Docker will mean we will not be able to turn you away! You have worked on prem, and if you have experience with Jenkins and Airflow; keep your phone nearby.
Characteristics: You are an autonomous worker with a ‘get things done’ mindset. While a bigger team, we are also tight-knit, therefore if you are no stranger to stepping in and rolling your sleeves up, we want to hear from you!

 A team player with a good sense of humour, a ""can do"" attitude and the ability to effectively communicate with a wide range of people.
 Just as important as your technology skills is your ability to fit into an established team of talented engineers.
