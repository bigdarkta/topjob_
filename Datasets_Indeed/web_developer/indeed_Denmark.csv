Frontend Developer,Merkle,Eksternt in København,"

Company Description: 

Want to join Denmark’s best digital agency?
 For the past 9 years, MyImage has named us just that. Right now, we’re looking for YOU and your talents to grow our team and help Merkle get even better.
 Can you crack the code to a sublime user experience, and would you like to develop not only cool solutions, but also yourself in an uplifting environment with fantastic benefits – then keep on reading!
 Merkle is a leader in data-driven customer experience management (CXM), and we deliver unique, personalized customer experiences across channels and devices. We provide expertise in customer experience strategy and consulting, user experience design, CRM, data management, commerce, mobile, content management systems (CMS), adtech and martech platforms.
 We embody the strong combination of local and global: Almost 300 colleagues work here in central Copenhagen, but we are also part of Merkle worldwide and dentsu – a global agency network covering 145 markets.
 At Merkle, our mission is to help our clients provide their customers with the best experiences possible. More than anything, this requires skills, passion and cooperation.
 Smells like team spirit
 We don’t have a slide for fast travel between our two floors, but we have plenty of reasons why you’ll love working at Merkle. We offer:

 A nice pension scheme
 Health insurance
 Your own balance of office vs. remote work
 Weekly Friday bars (yup, your weekend buzz is on us!)
 Daily-cious breakfast and lunch from our in-house chefs
 An unlimited amount of coffee, tea and supportive colleagues
 Wine tasting club, running club, game nights, grand parties, fun events
 A creative environment that lets you think 27 kilometers outside the box

 We have employees who’ve stayed with us for 5, 10, 15, even 20 years! This is surely due – in part – to our flexible working conditions and consideration for each person’s needs. There’s room for you to be yourself, including dressing however you like. We try our best to take good care of each other, our clients, and the world around us.
 This also means we don’t hire brilliant jerks. Do you have a knack for pitching the right ideas, but have your head up your own amazingness? Well, for that reason, we’re out. More than likely, though, you’ll make an awesome addition to our team, and we can’t wait to meet you!



Job Description: 

Along with 20+ dedicated front-end developers, you will be working on Danish and international projects, both B2C and B2B. The tech stack varies depending on the project, but our front-enders are currently focused on React and Vue. We are looking to add Next.js and Nuxt.js as an extra layer, and we are big fans of TypeScript.
 We work in teams with a lot of discussion and feedback across skills and disciplines, so you will never be left alone on a task.
 In your professional team here at Meldahlsgade, you will meet your like-minded people, some of the country's best front-end developers. To us, 'designing-in-the-browser' is key and the concept only gets soul and pulse when it can be experienced properly.
 You will be working closely with back-end specialists, art directors, and UX’ers to create the ultimate customer experiences across technologies, channels, browsers, and devices. To enable this, we always work agile and in sprints with proven processes, systems, and strong project management.
 Check out two incredible projects our developers are very proud of here and here.

 You will not be working on the same boring internal system for an eternity. We stimulate the nerd in you by providing a diverse workday with lots of challenges to keep your developer spirit alive and thriving.
 We even have a specific set of objectives to help you build more experience and climb the career ladder faster. We are also passionate about real-world knowledge sharing in our team, discussing client issues and learning from each other’s experiences. And you have regular 1:1 talks to keep track of your professional development and job satisfaction.

 You have 2+ years of experience in this role (full-time work, not internships).

 You are motivated by doing creative quality solutions and by being part of a team with skilled and talented colleagues.
 As a person, you are constructive and positive-minded.
 You are empathetic and have a great drive.

 You have experience with and opinions on: Javascript and CSS-frameworks, designing-in-the-browser, mobile and touch, web design, animation, accessibility and digital communication. You are always updated on modern front-end technologies like SSG, SSR etc.
 Also, we guess you have loads of experiences with, among other things:

 Building large-scale web solutions
 Knowing your basic HTML
 Looking closely into TypeScript, Node.js, Webpack and Git in your workflows

 Besides, it’s a plus if you know of Visual Studio, and have built solutions to .Net, MVC, Umbraco, EPiServer, Sitecore, etc.

 The role of the programmer is to transfer the project to the template.

Management Level Senior Associate 
 
Job Description & Summary 

Do you want to work in a dedicated team that develops software solutions focused on data? Do you want to be part of a diverse and talented group of data analysts, DevOps specialists, IT architects, application developers and business experts? Do you want to work with a technology stack that has the necessary capabilities to build unique applications, combining AI/machine learning, data analytics, micro service architecture, DevSecOps and traditional software? Then you should apply for the position as an experienced developer in PwC’s Data Factory team that is part of the Technology & Security department. We have a flat hierarchy and decisions are made jointly and are based on professional skills rather than who has the highest rank. 

Your role 
You will work with the development of products, focusing on building components that may be reused in several contexts. We aim to combine traditional software development with AI/machine learning to support and streamline processes in areas as diverse as case management, GDPR controls and sustainability. You will also participate in client-facing projects and solve complex problems using data analytics, e.g. for identifying fraud or data anomalies. You will be part of a team that seeks to streamline the processes of product development, maintenance and governance of our development platform. 

Join Technology & Security 
At PwC, we can offer a job in Technology & Security that is part of PwC’s One Consulting. You will work in an environment where humour, an informal tone and high professional quality form the basis of the culture in our department. You will be able to continue your professional development through collaboration, training and mutual inspiration on a daily basis with highly qualified colleagues. You will participate in exciting projects with great professional complexity, and you will be challenged to deliver solutions on time and in high quality. PwC is a leading consultancy firm that places great emphasis on the importance of data and security. We are a major global player in cybersecurity, and we have more than 4,000 security specialists across the world. Our office is located in Hellerup, and our department is growing rapidly. We are therefore looking for new colleagues who can help us solve the many exciting challenges that arise in the wake of the increasing focus on data-driven solutions to support processes and decisions. We act out PwC’s leadership values in the form of an attentive and coaching management style, and we will assign a dedicated career coach to you. 

Qualifications 
You want to develop and are eager to acquire new skills and share knowledge with your colleagues. You are able to work independently but you are also a team player who recognises that knowledge sharing is an important part of day-to-day work. You are a troubleshooter, and you get things done. You have at least five years of experience and are able to combine solid programming skills and theoretical analysis with your innovative mindset, applying alternative solutions. You want to create value, you dare to fail, and you learn from your mistakes. 

We expect that you are familiar with: 


various programming languages such as Java, GO and Python 
JSON and REST – for developing integrations/web services 
small-scale web development tasks, e.g. via React, but not actual UX 
various databases and the use of SQL queries 
IDEs, such as Visual Studio, and development environments, such as JupyterLab 
development platforms, such as Azure DevOps and GitHub, and the use of CI/CD 
container environments using Docker, Kubernetes and Rancher. 


It would also be an advantage if you are experienced in: 


AI/machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn 
ETL, data mining and transformation, and pre-processing 
Kafka or other message/queue systems 
SaaS solutions. 


Are you eager to make a difference? 
It is our committed staff and partners who make PwC what it is. Alongside Denmark’s leading enterprises, owner managers and public institutions, we work to build trust in society and help solve important problems. e.g. related to the increasingly important sustainability agenda. We do so based on our knowledge of audit, tax and advisory services. It is important for us to offer the most developing and flexible conditions to everyone pursuing a career with us, ranging from our efficient student employees to our experienced partners. Are you as eager to make a difference as we are? And do you have a good head on your shoulders, a big heart and a broad smile, then PwC may be the right place for you.

Mobile app developer (Arhus & Copenhagen),CHARLES,Eksternt in København,"

Do not contact us if you offer development services of any sort since we only hire directly.
The ideal candidate will be part of a team of 18 transitioning aggressively from pre-launch prototype to a commercial product.
We ultimately work on a solution that can solve world hunger and we need partner that are passionate and committed to such hard journey.
Core to that journey is our belief that engineers make reality out of dreams. We are inspired by the engineering quality and principles of companies like Tesla and SpaceX, specially the focus on obsessive focus, first principles and the power of manufacturing as a driver of innovation in engineering. Although we expect to build our company's culture, we believe it will be aligned with those principles (and ambition).

Unpaid internship during the summer (local or remote)


16,000 kr. salary for a part-time job while you study (on top of that, you can benefit from 6,397kr per month from state-sponsored SU )


42,000 kr salary after graduation

This is likely 25% over standard. That is because we are looking for the top 2-5% quality available in Denmark. Ie, we are looking for high performance, high potential candidates that can help us scaling fast from pre-launch while helping them realize their potential while studying and working in Denmark.
You will be fully responsible for building our 2 mobile apps, starting from the already existing API endpoints. The first app is basically composed of:

Marketing/promotional elements


Login and other access-related features


Scheduling of activities


App-baed ""remote control"" for our robot


Notification system


Operator actions

We are looking at someone that have experience and can execute on this project flawlessly and without major risk factors. The ideal candidate should have a good sense of aesthetics and should be able to develop without having designs, which may happen during the initial stage. Experience in web app development (backend or frontend is a nice plus).
We are strictly focused on folks willing to bring high performance and obsessive focus to our team. We want to treat you accordingly. You are willing to join a startup, and commit time to it success. You're good at making things happen against though deadlines and under strong individual goals. You're likely an engineer at heart when you address challenges and problems.

C/C++ Developer,Veo Technologies,København,"

  Veo is the world’s most exciting AI powered sports camera company. Our innovative and fully automatic camera solution enables sports teams to record their matches and training sessions without the need for a camera operator. We’re democratizing the world of sports by granting video analysis for teams on all levels - a privilege that used to be only for the few. More than 20,000 clubs and schools in 90+ countries use Veo, and more than 25,000 matches are uploaded every week.
 


 But that’s not the cool part about us.
 


 The cool part about us is our people. The strength of our brand, and our purpose and vision, have enabled us to attract some of the smartest minds in the world. They are the reason, we are able to create a great product and do it whilst enjoying ourselves.
 


 Growing as fast as we do in Veo also means that every day is different and exciting, both in the front line and in the back office.
 


 Veo Technologies is looking for developers for the Core Services Pipeline team. We're writing the components that process tens of thousands of recorded matches every month, optimize AI training, and make live streaming of amateur sports feasible globally. We're working closely with other teams in Veo providing the platform for making great products on the web, in the cloud and in the palms and sports pitches of our customers.
 


 We're in the last phases of replacing our legacy libav-based media pipeline with a more modular one based on Gstreamer, which gives developers more flexibility in designing new products, all while lowering the barrier of entry with regard to domain-specific knowledge about video. 
 

  We take time to optimize for developer experience and design for composability of modules with as few side effects as possible. We need a new candidate not for grokking legacy codebases, but rather for helping us build new stuff solving problems such as image stabilization, compositing and low-latency rendering.

At Veo we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Backend Developer,Januar,Eksternt in 1411 København,"
Are you an aspiring leader in craftsmanship looking for a great place to develop your creative skills? Want to be familiar with the latest trends and technologies to make web applications run smoothly and stable?
 Look no further, we offer a flexible environment open to new ideas and we are searching for pioneers ready to disrupt!
 (Update April 2022: Our tech team has tripled to ten people in a few months, so we are not urgently looking for new colleagues, but always open for a talk!)
 What is Januar? 
We are building the gateway to the new digitised financial system. We aim to enable access to payment accounts for cryptocurrency businesses, building the gateway between crypto and fiat.
 We base our business on trust and transparency, as well as solid expertise and experience in finance and crypto. We’re not all crypto experts, but we expect you to be curious and willing to both share your knowledge and learn from your colleagues.
 We’re a team of 30 now, and we expect to grow noticeably in size over the coming months. 
As part of the team in Januar, you will get:

Flexibility - work when and where you want (giving priority to team alignment and collaboration :-)
A new Macbook (or similar laptop) and other IT equipment you need
Highly skilled colleagues who are happy to both teach and learn
A human-centric, value-based culture
Best-in-class training in cryptocurrencies
Challenging and rewarding assignments; many of them end-to-end
Social activities and events - you’re welcome to arrange some, too!

 
 Your role
 In Januar, you’ll be a crucial and equal part of the team working on our core software platform. You’ll own the responsibility of our core software suite alongside the current team, working with an agile mindset that fits both a fintech and startup mentality. There will be plenty of room for you to define various aspects of your role.
 The team you’re joining
 Our tech team consists of 10 people who each have 10-20+ years of experience, so you’ll have the chance to learn a lot and pitch in with your own experience and ideas. Your role in the team is highly flexible and will primarily be defined by your wishes and ambitions - we believe that people should do what they do best. If we lack the skills for a given task, we’ll handle it as a team, either by educating one or more team members, or by whom we hire as the next to join the team.

 Skills and expertise
 The following description is us imagining the ideal candidate for the position - but we don’t expect you to tick all the boxes.
 Our needs are broad and change with the company’s rapid growth, so we’d also love to hear from you if you have more, less, or different experience.
 Maybe you have skills we didn’t even realise we need!
 It is a requirement that you have a valid work permit and that you live in Denmark or within Europe, as we are unfortunately not able to cover relocation costs.

 3+ years of professional experience doing backend development as part of a team
Fluent end efficient in the Java language
Hands-on experience with Spring/Spring Boot
Knowledge of SQL in any form, preferably Microsoft SQL-server context
Experience working in cloud environments
Understanding of how to build frontend-facing APIs
Proficient in working with git
Knowing the value CI/CD
Understanding of microservice architecture principles and do's & don'ts

Other qualifications

Fluency in English and high-level Danish skills
Knowledge of data analytics and reporting
Problem-solving aptitude
Analytical mind
Team-spirit

Nice to have

Node.js experience, frontend or backend
Experience with security audits of cloud-based platforms and/or in connection with API
Interest in trading, maybe even experience with trading yourself
Experience in doing low latency systems for use in trading environments
Understanding of blockchains in general
Understanding the importance of a well-functioning, solid DevOps experience

 We use Azure as our cloud provider, but if you come with extensive knowledge of AWS or similar, that will work for us.
 Proven experience from a similar role is a big plus. We expect you to have a keen interest in finance and cryptocurrency, but no pre-knowledge is required.
 Tools
 We don’t mind whether your preference is IntelliJ or notepad - whatever works best for you in collaboration with your team.
 You’re free to work on any platform you want, and we provide the hardware and software you need to do your daily work.
 We do expect you to use multi-factor login for our platforms and services in order to reduce attack-vectors.
 When can you join?
 Your starting date depends on what we agree upon - we do hope to bring you onboard as soon as possible, should there be a match between us.
 It is a prerequisite for employment that you can present a clean criminal record. And it is a requirement that you have a valid work permit and live in Denmark or within Europe.  
A fair chance
 We believe diverse teams help us make better products, and that everyone deserves a fair chance. We welcome all people regardless of age, gender, experience and background - what counts is that you can make a difference in our business together with the team. We are open to applications from all sections of society.
 If you are excited about the role and can add new experience and perspectives to Januar, do send us a motivated application.

 Our recruitment process
 We review applications on an ongoing basis and invite all suitable candidates for a brief initial call with our Head of People & Culture and Project Manager, where you’ll learn a bit more about Januar and how we work.
 If there is still mutual interest, we'll set up an interview with the hiring manager, so you can learn more about the specific job at hand. We might give you a small assignment that we can talk about in a second interview. If there is a good match professionally as well, you will be invited to meet more colleagues from our team. If the chemistry still feels right for both parties, we will look forward to welcoming you to Januar!

"C# Developer wanted for fun… We mean work, actual work (but...",Omnidocs A/S,1403 København,"
You have never heard of us
 And that is completely okay. What we can tell you is that more than two million users across the world are actively working with our software today. Our solutions exist in the enterprise workspace, and we have created software solutions for some of the largest companies in the world like Maersk, UBS, and Deloitte. 
We have a high focus on automation and for this purpose, we have built a proprietary data agnostic platform that generates documents in the cloud. We are at the forefront of the latest technologies and not afraid of new ideas. We always investigate which frameworks and technologies are most appropriate to solve a given problem and select the best ones. 
We work with integrations – meaning taking data from third-party systems and injecting them into, for instance, a Word document. We believe in a data-first approach, and our software helps our customers adhere to this way of working. 
We also have several productivity tools for Microsoft Office, which take all shapes and sizes. We have a tool for creating on-brand charts or tables, and another tool that helps you create accessible PDFs per the new EU regulations. 
We are always accepting and looking for new challenges. For this quest, we need more developers in our existing team. Keep reading if you are interested! 
The team
 The team consists of six awesome developers, and we are looking for at least one new member. The most important thing to say about our team is that we have fun. Secondly that the tasks we perform and the processes we follow are interesting and make sense. We constantly optimize and change things to adapt ourselves to the technology we use and the structures that make the most sense. Besides the development team, we also work very closely with our Support and Technology Operations team. 
What will you be doing?
 You will help us develop new features and adapt existing ones in our very large portfolio of products and features. We move around in the Azure space and do web development, front-end as well as back-end. We develop plugins for Office and at times full-blown desktop applications. 
We make integrations between third-party systems and Microsoft Office and bind the elements together to give our customers a seamless experience. No two organizations are the same, and as such our tasks are very different. More explicitly your tasks will be: 

Development of features/products
Participation in scoping of new tasks
Gaining knowledge of new technologies and constantly developing ways of solving the challenges our customers face
Continuous communication with the team about existing and future tasks

We always evaluate the skills of our employees, and your ambition dictates your future in Omnidocs. We have a focus on your personal development as an employee and we make sure that your tasks keep reflecting your increasing skill levels. We take pride in supporting you to grow into the areas that you find interesting. 
Who are you?
 We imagine that you have a relevant degree or have at least 2-3 years of experience with software development in C# or something comparable. Furthermore, the following are to some extent characteristic of you: 

You have experience with Microsoft Azure, alternatively, you know about cloud technologies and are a fast learner
You understand Windows and Microsoft Office but you are not necessarily a superuser
You have a very good technical understanding and know the importance of documenting your work
You possess a good understanding of the grounding principles of programming, and you are not scared of Java and TypeScript
You follow the latest trends for tools and processes inside development
You are fluent in English, verbally and in writing
You are ambitious and responsible
You enjoy having fun at work. Good humor is a plus.

What kind of company is Omnidocs?
 Our approach to how we work is closely aligned with our core values – take a look at our company values on our career site or watch our video here. 
Then you’ll get a good idea of who we are. 
We really believe that work should be both fun, engaging, challenging, and meaningful – and then some! Helpful and understanding colleagues, small talk and friendly jokes, good coffee, and awesome lunch in beautiful surroundings are just some of the big extras you will find in a workplace like Omnidocs. 
Our office is newly renovated and located in the heart of the historic neighborhood Christianshavn, surrounded by canals and great little cafés and restaurants. We enjoy our lunch in the fabulous local Italian restaurant called Undici. We have plenty of light and air while being close to everything – including the metro, the canals, and the city center. 
How to Apply
 Upload application and CV below – preferably as soon as possible – we review the applications on an ongoing basis. 
Please note: You can keep it simple. An application is not a writing contest, and half a page can easily be sufficient, just remember to include how you see YOU (interests and competencies) in this specific role. You can write more, of course, but don’t let your expectations of how long, academic, or well-worded an application should be, stop you from applying. Also – we accept applications and CVs in both Danish and English and we encourage all qualified applicants to apply regardless of age, gender, religion, country of origin, or ethnicity. 
If you have questions about the position, please contact Software Engineering Manager, Sebastian Ehlers, seb@omnidocs.com, or CTO, Martin Rafn Møller, mrm@omnidocs.com. 
Omnidocs is a hybrid company offering solutions and services that empower document creators around the world. Since 2004 we’ve been working with organizations to help save time and money with on-brand solutions that fuel productivity, embed compliance, and increase happiness; all in a smarter way. 
Today, we are 81 people in our offices in Copenhagen and New York and we are currently expanding with even more roles to fill. We have more than 2,500,000 users worldwide, and on the global scene, we serve clients such as UBS, Novo Nordisk, Maersk, Accenture, EY, PWC, Lincoln Financial Group, Colliers, KPMG, Vestas, Ericsson, Dentons, Carlsberg, and Nestlé.
