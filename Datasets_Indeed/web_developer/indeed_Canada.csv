 How do I Apply?

 For students, we believe evaluating you through relationships over resumes, and are focused on learning about who you are and what you’re interested in to uncover your true potential. In short, we don’t believe resumes will provide us with an accurate depiction of what you’re truly about in order to properly assess your potential. Instead we want to get to know YOU and hear about the experiences that have shaped you. We know… this might sound crazy but we do not want you to submit your resume instead we ask that as part of your application, you complete the below:

 1) Complete your PLUM Profile here

 2) Save your PLUM Profile as PDF. Click here to learn how

 3) Complete a very short one-way video interview by clicking here (if you have already done this, you don't need to do it again)

 4) When it prompts you to submit your resume, do not attach your resume! Instead, attach your most recent transcript and your PLUM profile in one PDF under the ""resume"" section. Cover letters are optional.

 Note: You do not need to complete your PLUM profile or video interview multiple times if you are applying to multiple positions. Also, we have full access to your entire profile from Plum and won’t use the screenshot but it’s a great reminder for each of you to have completed it.
 We thank you all for your interest in Scotiabank! However, only those selected for an interview will be contacted. If you require accommodation during the recruitment and selection process, please let us know. We will work with you to meet your needs

WEB DEVELOPER,Digital 22,"Halifax, NS","

Digital 22 is an inbound marketing, creative design, web development and Elite Hubspot marketing agency. Our team is based in the UK however Digital 22 has recently expanded to Nova Scotia and we are looking for a Web Developer to support our web team in Canada. It's an exciting opportunity to join at the start of our journey in Canada and play a major role in our growth plans.
 What’s the Job?
 You will be an integral part of delivering a top-class dev service to delight our clients.
 The majority of your time will be spent coding marketing assets, web pages and websites for our clients, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with an occasional dabble with API’s. All of this is done on Hubspot’s growing CMS.
 You won’t be dealing directly with clients, however, you’ll work closely with various teams internally to deliver high-quality client work. You’ll be required to ensure your part of the project is running smoothly and you’re working in line with the client’s brief, budget and deadline.
 In between all of this, you’ll proactively stay up to date with developments in the industry and HubSpot software. Then, bring these ideas to the table so we can discuss them as a team. This means we can grow in our roles and stay at the forefront of what we do. Plus, ‘Learn and Share’ is one of our core values.
 Who Are You?
 You must have two years of experience in a front-end dev role building websites. If it’s in an agency, we’ll be more impressed, as you will be familiar with the diverse clients and fast-paced environment.
 From those two years, we’re specifically looking for experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, experience with API’s, and working on some major CMS platforms (eg. WordPress or Drupal). Shopify and HubSpot experience is ideal but isn’t essential.
 Communication skills. There is a lot of collaboration so you are someone who enjoys working and communicating with others.
 What are some of the benefits of working at Digital 22?

Salary range $46,000 - $65,000 CAD
We have a 35.5 working hour week, each Friday we finish early so you can make the most of your weekend!
Opportunity for international travel
Health benefits
Personal learning and development plan. Our ethos is learning - invest in your development.
Structured review process: We believe it is important to get feedback, discuss your career and progression on a regular basis.

Front End Developer (Contract),BIMM,"Toronto, ON","
BIMM is booming, so we’re looking for an experienced Front End Developer (starting asap until Dec 2022, potential to perm) to join our team.
 WHO WE ARE
 For over 30 years, we’ve crafted flawless data driven creative solutions for some of the biggest brands in Canada and across the globe.

At the same time, you know when to ask for help and don’t let silly pride or ego get in the way, because after all, you are part of a team. This role will directly support our client Audi North America and have the opportunity to shape the development of their digital platform.
 “Initiative” is your middle name and you don’t give us a chance to chase you. We are on the hunt for people who have an innovative mindset (you still dream of that moonshot project, but are currently working on your side-gig)! Is this you?
 EXPERIENCE
 Must have:

 Knowledge of best practices building a clean codebase. eg. file maintenance, component structure
 Portfolio demonstrating your frontend skills
