Senior Web Engineer,LUSH Cosmetics,Remote,"
Senior Web Engineer
 Salary Banding Senior: £50,000 - £75,000
 Diversify our future We are building a brand that represents the people of the world. It’s what you do that counts, and we are always looking to expand perspectives and voices to shape our future. We see you, we celebrate you, we want you!
 Who we are You might know us as the inventors of the bath bomb, but there’s more to this great-smelling, privately-owned and family-run company than pioneering cosmetics. We believe our business should put more back into the world than it takes and demonstrate that capitalism can be a force for good. We fight cruel practices like animal testing, promote regeneration, and show that what’s inside counts - whether that’s an ingredient in a product, or the minerals in a smartphone.
 We’re leading the digital strategy and development for Lush globally, across many digital properties ranging from apps to websites. We’re a fast-paced, dynamic team that are comfortable with rapid change and are happy talking about and demonstrating our work to the wider business and stakeholders.
 What you’ll do: As a Senior Web Engineer, you’ll work with cross functional teams including Digital designers, back-end engineers, QA test engineers, your Product Lead, Business Analyst, stakeholders and many more to create beautiful web experiences and help shape the strategy. You’ll be building everything from powerful web applications to performant websites.
 It goes without saying that you’ll have an appreciation of what makes a design work with up-to-date knowledge of the latest innovations within CSS and JS. As well as considering the architecture of every feature we are building as part of the bigger picture to ensure we are always considering the core web vitals. At Lush, we operate as a sociocracy, so autonomy is highly valued and excelling in self-management and self-development is desirable.
 Who you are: You’ll identify the opportunities to reduce complexity and componentise code and be familiar with working with APIs, building for failure and hostile conditions. The majority of the sites and applications you’ll be working with are built using React, so 2 years of demonstrable commercial experience with it would be required.
 We want to see developers who are well versed in using tools/technologies such as:

React
Next.js
Node
GraphQL/Apollo
API-first solutions and integrations
Styled components/Styled System/SCSS
Jest, react-testing-library
Sketch/Figma
Webpack, npm, git
Project management tools; Jira
Express

 Bonus knowledge:

Internationalisation at scale
Web accessibility
CI / CD
Docker
Microservices based architectures

 As a Web team, we value developers who have the ability to communicate the benefits of technical solutions to non-technical project stakeholders effectively. We’re looking for someone who is comfortable mentoring others, but also keen to learn from their colleagues.
 What’s it like working for Lush People are at the heart of our business. We want you to enjoy and challenge yourself, build a career, and teach us what we don’t know, so we’ve created a culture where your job description is a starting point, not an end goal. Our working style is flexible, fluid, supportive, and authentic - if you’ve got the drive to push yourself and try different things, you will have our support.
 As we pride ourselves on internal development, priority will be given to candidates who have an in-depth knowledge of Lush coupled with the relevant experience and qualifications.  You can find out more about Lush Digital here - https://weare.lush.com/lush-life/our-company/we-are-digital/  If all this sounds like you please send us your CV and covering letter, detailing why you would be a perfect fit for the role along with your current salary and expectations.

 Employee perks: 50% discount on Lush products and spa treatments Profit-based bonus Pension scheme Day off for weekday birthdays Flexible working hours. Work life balance. Holiday purchase scheme Optional office spaces to work from in Soho, London and Poole, Dorset. Cycle to work scheme Discounted rail and bus season tickets The latest tech and whatever you need to do your best work.

At Holepunch, we’re building a peer-to-peer development platform that lets you build apps that don’t require infrastructure. No servers whatsoever.

We’ve started demonstrating what this future will look like with Keet, our P2P communications app.
