 A bit about us
 We're a small, friendly company of designers, developers, and engineers.

 A bit about you
 First and foremost; you are an expert full stack developer: from architecture development through to production delivery.

 You have a solid amount of industry experience, whether you've come from a formal qualification or made your own path.
 And you are probably interested in more than just vanilla web software. Maybe you've written high performance apps in Rust; compiled to WebAssembly. And if you have experience analysing and working with large datasets that would be super-interesting to us.
 We work in partnership with companies to develop products and so you will know about communication with clients and stakeholders both here in NZ and overseas.
 Finally, you have the right to live and work in Wellington, New Zealand. Ideally you're already here!

 Some benefits (in addition to a competitive salary)
 Our office is in the Wellington CBD with nice views over the city to the harbour.

 And we enjoy working with, and using, the latest tools and technologies.

 Still interested?
 Excellent! We have lots to talk about...

Software Developer,LMAX Group,"Auckland City, Auckland","
Description:
LMAX Group is looking for a new developer to join their Auckland based team.
 Our values:

 Commitment to quality. LMAX Group was an early adopter and continues to be a leader in the area of Continuous Delivery. We believe a system based on “fast feedback cycles” is a great way to build a stable, well performing system. To support this we employ a  lot of automated testing, automated deployment and continuous integration. The automated test suite gives our developers confidence to make significant changes to the system. 
Working collaboratively. Software is not built in a vacuum, people with blended skill sets working together produces the best results. We use practices like collaborative design and pair programming. This allows us to work together on design and implementation as well as  sharing knowledge and helping new starters get up to speed quickly. For testing we eschew a  “throw it over the wall” mentality and developers will write and do a lot of their own testing,  which frees up the test analysts to do higher value exploratory testing.

 Keeping it simple. Modern software systems are very complex. Simplicity helps us build a more reliable and higher performing system. We work hard to ensure our systems are as simple as  possible to solve the problems at hand. Unfortunately, simple isn’t easy and we will often put in that extra bit of effort to get us to a satisfactory solution.
 Always improving. We think we do a number of things well (many of our team have spoken at  conferences about how we build software and handle challenging performance problems), but we  recognise that we are far from perfect and can always get better. We regularly examine our  successes and failures to look at how we can improve. We have a generous training budget  for our technology staff.


Requirements:
What you’ll work on:
 Design. You will be working with other members of the team to determine how to implement a given feature or meet a specific requirement. This is a fairly fluid process with lots of discussion and white-boarding, while avoiding extensive documentation. Coding, and lots of it. The majority of our code base is in Java, which continues to be our language of choice - we stay up to date and use the latest versions and language features. There is a decent chunk of Web technology (Javascript, HTML, and CSS) and SQL too. Production support. A necessary part of any production system. All developers participate in supporting our business and technology operations staff to resolve issues as they occur. Performance testing and profiling. Working on a financial exchange brings some interesting throughput and latency challenges, so we care a lot more about software performance than many other organisations. This often requires investigative work and digging deep into the internals of our systems to understand how they behave.

 What we’re looking for:
 Above all we are looking for someone who shares our values and is great to work with. Compensation will be based on the level of experience and expertise that you bring to the team. Knowledge of our technology stack and business domain is useful, but by no means a requirement. However, you will need to be happy working with our set of technologies and be willing to retrain if required.
  Additional Notes:

 LMAX Group is an equal opportunity employer and actively seeks to ensure that we continue to attract applications from a diverse range of candidates to reflect the diversity that already exists across the organisation
 Optionally a small amount of international travel is available
 We manage our workflow to free up Friday afternoons to work on self-chosen projects outside of the immediate business priorities
 You must have appropriate eligibility to work in New Zealand.
