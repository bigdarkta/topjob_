Job Description







Location: Gippsland | Cockatoo


Job type: Part time / From 03/10/2022 - 16/09/2023




Organisation: Schools (Government)


Salary: Salary not specified




Occupation: Administration/Secretarial




Reference: 1295608 








Selection Criteria
 SC1 Demonstrated experience and skills in coordinating a specific education support function.
 SC2 Demonstrated capacity to supervise the work of other support staff and to develop procedures and guidelines relating to the work area.
 SC3 Demonstrated high level oral and written communication skills.
 SC4 Possess the technical knowledge and expertise relevant to the position.
 SC5 Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management in respect to the work area.
 SC6 Demonstrated commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.
 SC7 Demonstrated capacity to oversee and implement school web design and updates.
 Role
 Attendance will be 3 days a week, days to be negotiated.
 Performs and/or supervises tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice and school policy. This may include the supervision and coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program. Supervision and coordination would be limited to ensuring routine tasks are performed to required standards. Input into identifying training needs and development of education support class staff within the work area or educational program becomes an important feature at range 2.
 Specialised support to achieve specific outcomes is a feature of range 2. Typically this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the operation of a work area (e.g. managing the day to day operation of a school office) under the direction of the principal or another senior manager.
 Provides support to teachers and students that is beyond the routine support provided at education support class Level 1, range 1. Within an educational program assists teachers with the coordination of the support function, such as directing/organising the work of other support staff or providing a specialist support role.
 Undertakes medical intervention support tasks or other specialised student/teacher support roles that require specific training that must be updated from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
 Performs technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science and information technology laboratories would be typical examples.
 An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee's position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
 Responsibilities

Coordinate the delivery of administrative services within the school.
In consultation with the principal, determine and manage work priorities within the school office.
Develop and implement strategies to ensure effective administration procedures.
Maintain school's records system, including computerised student, staff and school records.
Coordinate the implementation of requisitioning, purchasing and issuing procedures.
Manage client reception.
Liaise with school staff in regard to support requirements.
Coordinate staff timetabling.
Other duties as directed by the principal team.

 Who May Apply
 Individuals with the aptitude, experience and/or qualifications to fulfill the specific requirements of the position.
