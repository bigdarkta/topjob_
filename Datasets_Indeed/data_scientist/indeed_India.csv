   COVID-19 Considerations

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.
 


   In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.
 


   Corporate Security Responsibility
   All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must:
 

 Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
 Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
 Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
 Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

data scientist (3 - 6 years),CRED,"Bengaluru, Karnataka","


what is CRED?



 CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.
  


 here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.
  


 here’s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a part of the team
  





 what will you do:


 own end-to-end business problems and metrics, build and implement ML solutions using cutting-edge technology.
 create scalable solutions to business problems using statistical techniques, machine learning, and NLP
 design, experiment and evaluate highly innovative models for predictive learning
 work closely with software engineering teams to drive real-time model experiments, implementations, and new feature creations
 establish scalable, efficient, and automated processes for large-scale data analysis, model development, deployment, experimentation, and evaluation.
 research and implement novel machine learning and statistical approaches
 publish and/or talk about your work at external conferences.






you should apply If you have:


 3 - 6 years of experience in data science.
 in-depth understanding of modern machine learning techniques and their mathematical underpinnings.
 demonstrated ability to build PoCs for complex, ambiguous problems and scale them up.
 strong programming skills (Python, Java, or Scala preferred).
 high proficiency in at least one of the following broad areas: machine learning, statistical modeling/inference, information retrieval, data mining, NLP






   how is life at CRED?
  


 working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.
  


 hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance.
  


 to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game.
  


 there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch.

Job Details 
What you will do 
Open Blue AI Platform group is playing a key part in realizing the promise of JCI digital transformation initiative – Open Blue. This group focuses on technologies like edge computing and ML Model “Edgification” (our trademarked term for optimizing a deep learning model for speed and size during production inferencing). We also develop embedded Data Science or AI solutions into the various JCI product offerings. Many times, this involves working with clients on client data, problems and KPIs for a first development, leading to a software product solution. We also have extensive existing sensor data on various machines from maintenance contracts. 

How you will do it 
While most of this position involves core data science in Python data science stack (see details below in “required qualifications”). There are software development tasks as well (Jira tasks, github, supporting testing). Or systems run in Docker. It is not uncommon for projects to lead to patents or papers – but it is not required. Typical projects may be 2-5 months. There are some Android projects, so experience in Java for DS tasks is helpful, but not required. We can get you up to speed on the Android development. On occasion, C++ is helpful, but not required. It helps to have a mindset to develop systems balancing flexibility, execution efficiency, robustness to future situations. Working with clients and product management we define a first Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and iterate over releases to clients. You can listen to the client, analyze their requirements, design and develop a solution, list assumptions for a successful delivery, help estimate the project plan, develop the solution and support the deployment. 
Many times we come across a need to solve some vertical problem new to us, or one that requires an algorithm family new to us. Take initiative to educate yourself, read survey or conference papers, find candidate open source libraries on github, look for complementary data sets. The ability to constantly learn and innovate is very desirable. It is always safe to ask questions. 

Information Security Responsibilities  

Adhere to JCI policies, guidelines and procedures pertaining to the protection of information assets. 
Adhere to JCI product security standards and guidelines for secured software product development. 
The software, licenses, shall be deployed and used only in accordance with JCI licensing agreements.

What we look for 
Required 

Have analyzed, trained and deployed at least three data mining models in the past. If the candidate did not directly deploy their own models, they will have worked closely with others who have put their models into production. The models should have been validated as robust over at least an initial time period. Models that have only been used for a one-off don’t count. 
8+ years of industry work experience specifically developing data mining models which were deployed and used. 
Programming experience in Python is core using data mining related libraries like Scikit-Learn, NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. Past DS experience in R, SAS, Matlab or other systems is valid, but we need people comfortable in Python, and who can pass basic interview questions on Python. 
Data mining algorithm experience in at least 3 algorithms within any of the bullets below:- 
   
Deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras, Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) or related). Valid transferrable skills include PyTorch. Common architectures we use includes Transformers, LSTM, EfficientDet, YOLO, ResNet.

 CONFIDENCE allows athletes to make quick decisions on the field, to reach higher. For us at adidas confidence means acknowledging that we don’t have all the answers. But we are willing to take risks, we try new things. And if we fail, then this is part of our learning – it helps us improve.
 COLLABORATION. Every elite athlete relies on partners: coaches, teammates, and nutritionists. We, too, know that we are stronger together. Winning as one team takes open and candid dialogue, inclusiveness and trust in each other’s abilities and talents. 
Being the best sports company in the world takes CREATIVITY. No great athlete succeeds by copying their predecessors’ training plans and strategies. We have to be open to new ideas, explore, gain an edge and stand out. Only then can we succeed.









ADIDAS CELEBRATES DIVERSITY, SUPPORTS INCLUSIVENESS AND ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION IN OUR WORKPLACE. WE DO NOT TOLERATE THE HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION TOWARD ANY OF OUR APPLICANTS OR EMPLOYEES. WE ARE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.

 About OakNorth


    Small and medium-size enterprises (SME) are one of the biggest drivers of growth and innovation in economies all over the world. Despite these companies being a powerful force in the economy, many SMEs find it difficult to raise capital during critical stages of their company growth.

At OakNorth, our mission is to help lenders fill this gap which we refer to as the “Missing Middle.” We are building a SaaS platform called the Credit Intelligence Suite which transforms commercial lending by helping banks build deeper relationships with their clients, open new, more profitable opportunities, whilst delivering credit decisions up to ten times faster than traditional models, with lower risk and greater efficiency.

 We have ambitious goals for this platform, and to help us realise them we’re looking for experienced software engineers who are just as focused on the product side of engineering as they are on the technical. You’ll be joining our global engineering team, which is less than 100 engineers, to make a big impact on the direction of our technology platform and most importantly, on the day-to-day workflows of our customers.

 About the company



 Brief- Delhivery is India’s leading fulfillment platform for digital commerce. With its nationwide network extending beyond 18,000 pin codes and 2,500 cities, the company provides a full suite of logistics services such as express parcel transportation, LTL and FTL freight, reverse logistics, cross-border, B2B & B2C warehousing and technology services. Delhivery has successfully fulfilled over 550 million transactions since inception and today works with over 10,000 direct customers, which includes large & small e-commerce participants, SMEs, and over 350 leading enterprises & brands.
     


 Vision- Since its inception in 2011, Delhivery has become India’s leading supply chain services company. Our vision is to become the operating system for commerce in India, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, high-quality logistics operations, cutting-edge engineering, and technology capabilities.
     


 Team- Delhivery was founded in 2011 by Sahil Barua, Mohit Tandon, Bhavesh Manglani, Suraj Saharan, and Kapil Bharati and is now 40,000+ people strong.
     


 About the team



 The analytics and BI team at Delhivery is a “business first data team”. We are part of both the technology and business teams, and our mandate is to 
      identify and solve high-impact business problems using data and quantitative methods. To put it simply, everyone in the team is good at both understanding business and playing with data, and that is what we expect out of future employees as well.
     


 We deliver more than 10 packages 
      each second, and each package gets scanned, on average, 15 times. Conservatively, that is 13 million records a day from package scans alone. The scale and complexity of the business, and data, means that there is a massive opportunity for our team to have an impact on the firm’s finances and operations.
     


 A large part of the work consists of understanding and manipulating data, finding patterns, linking it to existing and prospective business problems, and telling stories linking them. Along the way, we build some models, write some “smart” reports and build the odd dashboard. Occasionally we might put a model in production in collaboration with the tech and product teams.
     


 Each person in the team takes end-to-end ownership of an entire problem statement - from talking to the concerned teams and defining it, gathering and putting together the data, analysing the data, building models and finally telling a story in a way that can be easily implemented by business.
     


 Culturally, we are ambitious (in terms of the work we take on), experimental (always looking for new and improved ways of doing things) and work at a fast pace. The problems we take on are 
      necessarily ambiguous and vague, and each member of the team is expected to take end-to-end responsibility, and make decisions independently.
     


 About the role



 We need crazy (no exaggeration) algorithm designers to “perform gymnastics” with the firm’s data, draw analogies and find patterns, and tell stories that have not yet been told, and which will help the firm solve pressing business problems.
     


 A very small sample of the problems you might work on:
     



         Design and implement smart dashboards and reports that tell the whole story by themselves, without relying on the user to drill down or make choices. For example, can the CEO get a daily automated report that talks about everything significant that happened in the business the previous day?
       


         Recommend how to best utilise our trucks for in-city deliveries in order to reduce costs. The approaches we have come up with so far for this include some combination of computational geometry, genetic algorithms and operations research.
       


         We do a large number of our last mile deliveries using independent contractors. How do we price our arrangements with them?
       



 We need fundamentally curious people who are happy to try new (and potentially unusual) approaches to solving the problems. We also need “algorithmic generalists” - people who are familiar with a very wide range of algorithmic approaches, and are always willing to learn and try out new things.
     


 Broad responsibilities:
     



         Understand business problems and translate into computational / data problems. And then convert the solutions back to the data domain
       




         Develop models, algorithms and heuristics to solve business problems in an efficient and time-bound manner
       


         Develop logical metrics to evaluate and monitor the business
       


         Build impactful and automated representations / visualisations of underlying data and key metrics in order to enable the business to make key decisions
       



 The role reports directly to Karthik Shashidhar, 
      Senior Vice President, Analytics and Business Intelligence.
     


 Required Qualifications



 We are looking for people who are excited by data, and excited by business, and excited in bringing the two together to create high impact. We are a fast-paced team, and expect quick turnarounds. Most of the problems we work on are ambiguous, and resolving ambiguity is a key part of the role.
     


 Key requirements
     



         Bachelors/Masters degree in 
        Computer Science and Engineering / Mathematics / Statistics from a top-tier institution (either in India or abroad)
       


         Strong at algorithms, classic artificial intelligence (
        not machine learning) and heuristics
       


         Very good at mathematics and logic
       


         Willingness to learn and use new technologies and programming languages
       


         Ability to work with “big data”
       


         Strong written, oral and visual communication skills
       


         Common sense, and an appreciation of common logical fallacies
       



 Knowledge of 
      R is a massive bonus.
     


 For this role, we are hiring across experience levels. We pay market salaries, including ESOPs.

We knew that domain names had to evolve in order to serve their purpose of memorable online identities.Enter Radix. When the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers opened the door to new top level domains other than the .com, .net, .org etc., we knew it was the perfect opportunity to solve a growing customer problem.
Equipped with powerful and meaningful new extensions such as* .tech, .online, .store, .fun, .site, .press *etc. we set out on a mission to eliminate the distinction between the real names and internet addresses of individuals and businesses.

And here we are, with almost 6 million domains already registered on our extensions, we are well on the path towards revolutionizing the internet. Brands like Viacom (www.viacom.tech), Emirates (emirates.store), Doordash (order.online), CES (ces.tech) and many more have already made the switch. It’s only a matter of time before the rest of the world does it too. To sum it up, the internet history is being rewritten and Radix is at the core of it.

Who We Are


 Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities. BCG was the pioneer in business strategy when it was founded in 1963. Today, we work closely with clients to embrace a transformational approach aimed at benefiting all stakeholders—empowering organizations to grow, build sustainable competitive advantage, and drive positive societal impact.
 


 Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives that question the status quo and spark change. BCG delivers solutions through leading-edge management consulting, technology and design, and corporate and digital ventures. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization, fueled by the goal of helping our clients thrive and enabling them to make the world a better place.
 

 Practice Area Profile

 BCG GAMMA combines innovative skills in computer science, artificial intelligence, statistics, and machine learning with deep industry expertise. The BCG GAMMA team is comprised of world-class data scientists and business consultants who specialize in the use of advanced analytics to get breakthrough business results. Our teams own the full analytics value-chain end to end: framing new business challenges, building fact-bases, designing innovative algorithms, creating scale through designing tools and apps, and training colleagues and clients in new solutions. Here at BCG GAMMA, you’ll have the chance to work with clients in every BCG region and every industry area. We are also a core member of a rapidly growing analytics enterprise at BCG - a constellation of teams focused on driving practical results for BCG clients by applying leading edge analytics approaches, data, and technology.
 

 What You'll Do

Software Engineer - Python & NLP,Reverie Language Technologies,"Bengaluru, Karnataka","
Why we exist:
 The Indian internet has exploded. Over half a billion Indians will be online before the end of this year. Most of these Indians will prefer using their own language online. And next to nobody is building solutions for them. They are prevented from using the internet to its fullest potential because English forms a language barrier. Whenever they visit a site or app, they are met with a wall of text in a language that they do not understand. We at Reverie believe in language equality on the internet. It’s what drives us and gives what we do meaning. Language equality basically means that every Indian should enjoy the same range of options and experiences online in their own language that an English speaker does online.  What we do:
 We take immense pride in the fact that we tackle some of the most complex and impactful problems Indian language users currently face today. We’re working towards our mission of language equality by building a full-stack of language technologies and solutions, spanning fonts, font rendering, transliteration, translation, app & website localization in real-time, Indian language input (check out our Swalekh keypad on the App Store here), Indian language voice assistants, and Indic search, to empower the Indian language user and let them tap into the possibilities the internet offers them.  What we DON’T care about:
 Your age, gender, where you went to college, or your academic scores.  What we DO care about: ·
 Our mission resonates with you · You have an insatiable curiosity, which means you’ll figure a way out even in an unfamiliar environment. · And finally your integrity and work ethic

 Job summary 
Our customers have immense faith in our ability to deliver packages timely and as expected. A well planned network seamlessly scales to handle millions of package movements a day. It has monitoring mechanisms that detect failures before they even happen (such as predicting network congestion, operations breakdown), and perform proactive corrective actions. When failures do happen, it has inbuilt redundancies to mitigate impact (such as determine other routes or service providers that can handle the extra load), and avoids relying on single points of failure (service provider, node, or arc). Finally, it is cost optimal, so that customers can be passed the benefit from an efficiently set up network. 

 Core Transportation Technology (CTT) is hiring Senior Applied Scientists to help improve our ability to plan and execute package movements. As a Senior Applied Scientist of CTT, you will lead an innovative team of scientists who use Machine Learning to create state-of-the-art solutions for Amazon customers. You will analyze and model terabytes of data to solve real-world problems. You will own end-to-end business problems/metrics and directly impact the profitability of the company. Your models will predict the shipping cost at Day 1 and help improve quality of upstream data (such as through corrections to weights and dimensions in product catalog). Using signals from within the transportation network (such as network load, and velocity of movements derived from package scan events) and outside (such as weather signals), you will build models that predict delivery delay for every package. These models will help improve buyer experience by triggering early corrective actions, and generating proactive customer notifications. 

 Your role will require you to demonstrate Think Big and Invent and Simplify, by refining and translating Transportation domain-related business problems into one or more Machine Learning problems. Your model choices will include, but not be limited to, generalized linear models , tree ensembles, deep learning architectures like MLPs and transformers, and Q-learning models. You will use techniques such as LIME and SHAP to make your models interpretable for your customers. You will be leading high impact business projects and mentoring other scientists, engineers in the use of ML techniques. You will employ a family of reusable modelling solutions to ensure that your ML solution scales across multiple regions (such as North America, Europe, Asia) and package movement types (such as small parcel and truck movements). Your models are expected to be of production quality, and will be directly used in production services. 

 You will work as part of a diverse data science and engineering team comprising of other Applied Scientists, Software Development Engineers and Business Intelligence Engineers. You will participate in the Amazon ML community by authoring scientific papers and submitting them to Machine Learning conferences. You will mentor Applied Scientists and Software Development Engineers having a strong interest in ML. You will also be called upon to provide ML consultation outside your team for other problem statements.

    Small and medium-size enterprises (SME) are one of the biggest drivers of growth and innovation in economies all over the world. Despite these companies being a powerful force in the economy, many SMEs find it difficult to raise capital during critical stages of their company growth. Traditional commercial lending is optimised to make loans that are either too small to be effective or too large and expensive to be practical. At OakNorth, our mission is to help lenders fill this gap which we refer to as the “Missing Middle.” We are building a SaaS platform called the Credit Intelligence Suite which transforms commercial lending by helping banks build deeper relationships with their clients, open new, more profitable opportunities, whilst delivering credit decisions up to ten times faster than traditional models, with lower risk and greater efficiency.
  


 Our Investors


    OakNorth Holdings (the group which includes OakNorth Bank plc and the various OakNorth software entities around the world) has raised over $1bn from leading investors, including: Clermont Group, Coltrane, EDBI of Singapore, GIC, NIBC, SMBC, Toscafund, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund.
  


 We have ambitious goals for this platform, and to help us realise them we’re looking for experienced software engineers who are just as focused on the product side of engineering as they are on the technical. You’ll be joining our global engineering team, which is less than 100 engineers, to make a big impact on the direction of our technology platform and most importantly, on the day-to-day workflows of our customers.
  


 Our Customers


    In addition to OakNorth’s own bank in the UK, the software is also being deployed by banks around the world, including: Capital One, Fifth Third, PNC, SMBC, Customers Bank, Old National Bank, Modern Bank, and Lafayette Square in the US, and ABN Amro, NIBC and OIMIO in Europe.
  


 Thank you very much for your interest in OakNorth


    We are happy to consider you for roles within our group of companies. If we can identify a match between your skill set and our immediate recruiting needs, please expect to hear from us very soon. If we are unable to identify a fit in the near term, please note that we intend to retain the data you send to us so we may contact you in the future.
