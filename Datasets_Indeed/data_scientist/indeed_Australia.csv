To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features. 
Aside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc. 

 About the opportunity 
The Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both. 
One aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms. 


You will be responsible for:


Developing proof of concept algorithms and prototypes for features that will be continually evolving in Python and C++.
Writing clear documentation to help define features, including use cases, dataset specifications, performance targets, etc.
Making use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (eg NN, CNN, RNN) utilizing large datasets to train algorithms.
Providing guidance to embedded software engineers to enable algorithms to be used on specific embedded hardware platforms.
Assisting with business pursuit activities such as working with potential partners, assisting customers to evaluate our technology and fielding questions from customers.
Responding to customer-reported issues when required in order to fix problems or limitations encountered in real-world conditions.
 About you 
We value the breadth and depth of experience that our people bring to their work. We are seeking people with a good mix of technical competency and personal capability. Specifically, we are looking for people with: 



A Masters or PhD (awarded or currently completing) in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, or equivalent industry experience
Strong theoretical understanding of machine learning concepts such as CNNs, RNNs, etc.
Experience with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or similar.
Experience writing code in Python and/or C++, ideally in a commercial environment.
Evidence of producing high-quality research outcomes and in disseminating effectively to academic and industry settings.
 Desirable 



Understanding of traditional computer vision and/or image processing techniques.
Experience working on research in a commercial environment.
Experience with practical data science or statistical analysis.
Experience explaining and discussing technical topics with varied audiences. For example, talking with customers, internal engineers, or highly technical peers.

Data Scientist,"Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc.",Canberra ACT,"
 Overview: 
  Systems Planning and Analysis Australia Pty Ltd (SPA Australia) provides operational analysis and decision support services to the Department of Defence. We draw on a range of data and information sources in order to generate information-rich, user-friendly products that provide insights and recommendations to enhance Defence capability. SPA Australia is growing Australia's sovereign capability through local upskilling of its workforce by drawing on processes and tools used by our parent company SPA US, which has supported the US Department of Defense for the past 49 years. We provide formal and informal training opportunities for our team members.

 SPA has a near-term need for a Junior Data Scientist/Analyst to work within a small, highly specialised team to collate, wrangle, transform, analyse and visualise a diverse range of sensitive data in support of specific current and future Navy capabilities. Responsibilities: 
  Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At SPA, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works” in order to generate insights and recommendations to improve operational effectiveness and other outcomes.

 We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you will fit in well with our multi-disciplined team of analysts.

 We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we will spend a lot of time combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modelling happen. This allows the data to be processed, analysed and visualised prior to further analysis being undertaken by domain experts in order to generate actionable insights and recommendations for Navy. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious. Qualifications: 
 
 Required Qualifications:


 Bachelor’s degree in data science, data analytics, software engineering, or related STEM field.
 Experience conducting data analysis and assessments and presenting results. Strong communication skills, both verbal and written.

 Ability to work well within a team environment alongside technical and operational specialists
 Ability to get and maintain a Positive Vetting (PV) Australian Defence security clearance. Applicants must be eligible to obtain and maintain an appropriate Australian security clearance. More information on eligibility for an Australian security clearance can be found at: https://www.defence.gov.au/security/clearances/about/vetting-assessment#eligibility.
 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and/or Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are applicable to this role and as such, the position will or is likely to require access to material controlled by ITAR and EAR (Controlled Material). Therefore, any person occupying the position must be able to satisfy ITAR and EAR controls, which may require specific authorisation to access Controlled Materials. Accordingly, your citizenship, previous citizenships, race or nationality, or substantive contacts where such contacts are affiliated with proscribed countries under ITAR may be a factor in determining your suitability for this role. Further information on this requirement can be found at: https://spa.com/about/compliance-statements/. If you are concerned about whether you will satisfy the requirements of the role insofar as they relate to ITAR and EAR, you should contact SPA Recruiting at recruiting@spa.com, who will be able to provide you with relevant information.

We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:

Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
 Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
 Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
 Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
 Contributing to research whitepapers.
 Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation

Who you are:

You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.
 Post-graduate qualifications in data science or similar (statistics, computer science)
 Strong programming skills with knowledge of Python, SQL and Unix
 Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)


You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
 Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.

The perks:

The opportunity to ride a rocket ship. You’ll play a pivotal part in our business during its ‘scale up’ phase by supporting the delivery of game-changing new products.
 An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
 The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.
 Career progression galore. The company is growing at a crazy rate and you will be too!

 Ability to make decisions in the face of ambiguity
 A desire to experiment, innovate and learn from both successes and failures
 Excellent communication skills: ability to work independently across all levels of the organization, both locally and globally
 Enjoyment for working as a team with a strong sense of ownership and personal achievement

 What will I be working on?

 Research, implement and publish novel machine learning and statistical approaches

 Additional Information
  We have a number of current employees who split their time between lecturing at University and working for Amazon. Please let us know if this is of interest to you. 
 
 We provide full visa sponsorship which is a relatively fast process as we have been successful in obtaining Distinguished Talent visas for this team (typically takes weeks rather than months).
 
 Full domestic and international relocation is also provided.

Why you'll love CUBE?

Immediate global impact: CUBE is a well-established player in RegTech (we were around before RegTech was even a thing!), and our category-defining product is used by leading financial institutions around the world (including Revolut, Citi, and HSBC). We have an audience across 150 countries, and they love CUBE.
Quantity & quality of data: The stage has literally been set: over the past 10 years, the five engineering teams at CUBE have built solid foundations for data collection, transformation, and classification. 
A rich & complex dataset: The main dataset is not only already structured, but also longitudinal and multilingual. We've tracked changes to regulation over time and built in-house translation models for 60+ languages.
Cutting-edge Regulation Transformation Engine: RegTransform is the technological magic that transforms regulatory data into regulatory intelligence at a scale and quality not possible at a human level. To enable this transformation, our data science team is actively developing and deploying state-of-the-art Computer Vision, NLP and ML models to identify relevant categories and extract key information (entities, relationships, ...) from the unstructured data and generate high quality structured data. 
Always learning: Part of your job is to stay up-to-date with the latest research, and share your learning with the AI teams at CUBE. You'll have a training budget and a conference budget. In the mid-long term, we're aiming to collaborate with universities.
Employee-first work-life policy: CUBE went fully remote before the pandemic even hit, because we wanted to define the future of work. As a CUBER, you'll be able to design your home office and choose your own work equipment. Unable to work from home one week, or desperate for in-person interaction with colleagues? No problem—book a room in a coworking space.
Sustainable, customer-driven growth: We are a bootstrapped company funded by customers and strategic private investment. This means that growth is sustainable, and product development is very closely aligned with customer needs.
Extremely bespoke hiring process: At CUBE, we're trying to flip hiring on its head: the objective of the process is to create a personalized job description (and title). This page sets the general context. We'll collaboratively determine the best role for you, given your interests, CUBE's needs, and other members of the team.


 More About CUBE
 CUBE was founded in 2011 to transform the way global financial institutions manage regulatory change. Few financial institutions have instant access to the regulatory intelligence and analytics required to understand the impact of regulatory change, and tackle it, quickly and cost-effectively.
 Utilizing Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, CUBE’s enterprise-wide RegTech solution de-risks the regulatory change process and dramatically cuts compliance costs. CUBE is a fast-growing business, with offices in the UK, USA, and Australia.

 That's why at CUBE, we aim to compress the hiring timeline to between 5 and 10 days (from the first-round interview to the final round). There's no HR screen, culture fit interview, or coding on a whiteboard. Just high-quality info flow in both directions.

 About the Centre for Digital Transformation of Health
 The Centre for Digital Transformation of Health is a cross-disciplinary centre that sits in the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, and the School of Computing and Information Systems.

 In a typical week at work, you may:

Work closely with the Centre’s experts in data governance and law and the MACH/DT4H Committee, to drive the development, piloting, evaluation and eventual operationalisation of processes and infrastructure for sharing routinely collected clinical data across organisations
Work with team members and partners with analytical, data infrastructure, computing, education and stakeholder engagement expertise, plan and develop innovative forums (such as concept development workshops and datathons/hackatons) and mentoring schemes
Mentor participants in the Learning Healthcare System Academy- the Centre’s flagship professional development program for clinicians

Children’s Medical Research Institute (CMRI) was Australia’s first dedicated paediatric research facility and is now one of the world’s most highly regarded independent medical research organisations. Our research focuses on the four key areas impacting children’s health: cancer, genomics and genetic diseases, neurobiology, and embryology. Our strong international reputation is based on decades of significant research outcomes in these areas of specialty. CMRI is also home to the world-first proteomics project, ProCan, which is changing the way cancer is diagnosed and treated. CMRI’s research programs are supported by state of the art facilities and committed research and support staff. Our achievements are made possible by a loyal network of community supporters, highly engaged donors, and the very successful Jeans for Genes® and Great Cycle Challenge fundraising campaigns.
A data scientist position is available in the ProCan Cancer Data Science (CDS) Group, led by Dr. Qing Zhong. ProCan (the ACRF International Centre for the Proteome of Human Cancer) is a world-first initiative developed and launched in September 2016 by Professors Phil Robinson and Roger Reddel, and established with a $10 million grant from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF). Equipped with six SCIEX mass spectrometers and a supercomputer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes tumour samples through a proteomic method, DIA-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of the goals of ProCan is to measure proteins in tens of thousands of cancers of all types with known treatment outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational tools and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying cancer, 3) development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-scale, high throughput proteomics, and 4) implementation of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive, preventive, personalized medicine.

Building a Uniswap SOR (smart order router)

About us
Deeplink is an Ethereum-based deep-learning protocol allowing blockchains to maintain On-chain Neural Networks while introducing programmability, machine learning and on-chain data science into blockchains. In addition, other Ethereum or EVM compatible chains and protocols can use on-chain neural networks and agents to improve efficiency, on-chain execution capabilities and security.
We are true believers in the spirit of crypto and blockchain—of economic Freedom, where everyone should have access to financial freedom. We are big believers in decentralisation, fairness & transparency. We live and breathe in crypto and blockchain 24/7. We are extremely passionate about building open-source tools to innovate. All Deeplink technology, engineering and technical concepts, research, codes, data and product development methodologies are public and open-source.
We believe building developer tools for AI & ML ecosystem to build, test and deploy ML models directly into EVM compatible chains with basic deep learning capabilities will revolutionise the DeFi and many web3 applications, protocols and their ecosystem.
About the use case
Uniswap is the largest decentralised crypto exchange (or DEX) operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap’s average daily trading volume was US$220 million in October 2020, and today, it is responsible for over $1 billion. We estimate by 2024, decentralised exchanges will exceed the centralised exchanges by activities, volume and users.
Uniswap’s large number of activities resulted in random requests, congested transactions, variable Uniswap fees, and variation in Ethereum gas fees. As a result, there are many inefficiencies in the Uniswap protocol/ecosystem. For example, consider a bustling Sunday market where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services whereby things can go incredibly wrong during rush hours. Uniswap traders often spend significant slippage and unnecessary protocol and Ethereum gas fees.
There are three main users/stakeholders;

Traders


LPs (liquidity providers)


The Uniswap project (protocol)

Deeplink v2 is built using deep reinforcement learning to simulate a real-world Uniswap environment/different scenarios (HTR, UTS, low and high supply & demand, high activities). With the vast amount of L3 Atom’s historical and live Uniswap data, Deeplink can simulate different market conditions in parallel. The DRL policy will define inefficiencies and rules. Agents will be punished as they spend more fees when choosing inefficient trade routes.

Analytics Lead,Drumline Digital,Remote in Chippendale NSW 2008,"What is Drumline?
Drumline Digital is an agency bridging the gap between marketing and technology, founded to do 3 things:
· understand how digital channels meet customers’ needs
· champion an experiment-driven mindset in our clients to build experiences based on customer understanding and measure the outcomes
· ensure that the right tech foundations are in place to deliver on those promises
We’re a small, tight team and we thrive on solving hard problems for our clients and for ourselves. This means constantly evolving the ways that we work, and we rely on each other to shape how we get to the right solutions.
It’s time for us to expand our team further as we’re growing quickly and we’re eager for folks ready to bring their own perspectives and challenging ideas. If that’s you, we’d love to have a chat.
The Role – the reason you’re reading this
Creating experiences that matter for businesses and customers means using data to investigate, evaluate and prioritise. This Analytics Lead role is an awesome chance to embed our practice from the start, working directly with the founders and engineering team, focused entirely on drawing insight from digital behaviours, and automating insight for the rest of the team. It’s an opportunity to bring together a human-focused view of behaviour, with leading analytics techniques applied through digital tools.
That’s more than a few buzzwords, so let’s simplify. You’d be leading our function that has 3 main components:
· Digital analytics and insights using Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Contentsquare through a code-first approach
o Note: we aren’t an implementation shop! We care what the data say, not just that it exists in a report!
· Building and applying experimentation models that support evaluation and identification of experimental outcomes, like helping tests go faster using CUPED, or prioritising activities based on minimum detectable effect sizes
· Helping to build our automated analytics capability! We’re already into our in-house product development and would love a bright analytical person to jump in with both feet to accelerate our growth.
We’re a small team, so you can get in on the ground floor with a very high growth ceiling in technical skill development, team leadership and business acumen. You’ll be working with the leadership team every day, as a core partner in building the foundations of Drumline Digital.
You
You’ve got a few years in analytics or data science under your belt, with experience in digital tools and platforms, ideally working hand in hand with business stakeholders. One of your joys in life is finding something no-one has seen before and seeing change happen based on your findings.
You’re eager to learn, work with people who will support and challenge you and in turn want to support and challenge us!
If we are going to break it down, here’s the wish list for our Analytics Lead
· Demonstrated ability to find insight and opportunities from data, for customers and businesses
· Effective communication and storytelling to senior stakeholders using data
· Demonstrated experience in modelling, at least one of: unsupervised segmentation, RFM, customer lifetime value, marketing attribution, image and video classification
· Experienced in R or Python programming (R preferred)
· Strong understanding of statistical concepts relating to experimentation, Bayesian decisioning, frequentist statistical confidence, and experimental design
· The ability to translate mathematics and statistical operations to decisions using R or Python (R preferred)
· Foundational understanding of programming for production environments, including elements such as scheduled scripts, utilising Docker (or similar) and cloud computing.
Transparency is really important to us in communication and decision making. For that reason, here’s the compensation range for this role:
$145,000 – $165,000 package
Beyond money, we hope that you want to work with us because you’re thinking about your career and what you’d like to be an expert in in 3-5 years. Tell us! We’d love to help you achieve it.
We know we’ve got a lot to cover on our wish list. If you don’t have every box ticked to the max - that’s ok! Let’s have a chat anyway. We’re big on developing people and we want to make sure we find the person with the right kind of growth mindset to turn this role into the best it can be over the coming months and years.
Why you’ll love Drumline
We’re taking an industry in Australia that is still nascent and making it into a global leader. Data-driven thinking is either incredibly costly, or too generalised. We bridge that gap, then we automate it to something anyone can apply and make sense of. We bring the know-how and skills to make our clients hyper-personalised powerhouses, without spending millions in tech or big teams.
Since we’re basically just a bunch of analytics and digital nerds, we love figuring out hard problems that give us 3 big ticks: it works for customers, it works for the business and it’s something we haven’t been able to do before!
We’re founded on some simple values
· Be humble; ready to learn in any circumstance and admit the limits of your knowledge
· Be honest; telling our clients and our team what they need to hear, because it’s the right thing to do – and knowing that constructively challenging makes for better solutions
· Be hungry; pushing each other to continue learning and pushing the boundaries of what has been done to achieve better results
· Be human; we care deeply about our team, clients and the customers who we design for – that means treating people with respect and acknowledging how we can support their whole lives, not just their professional ambitions.
Also just worth noting the role is Sydney-based and would be hybrid between work from home and our office in Chippendale. We’ve got a great setup here that we love and love to share it along with a number of other benefits:
· Regular office events
· Espresso machine for the mornings, beer and cider taps for the evenings
· The stereotypical table tennis table, the less stereotypical basketball court
· Free breakfast on Tuesdays
· Tons of opportunities for training and professional development

 We've created a culture that values diversity where people can truly be themselves! We care a lot about growing the Australian AI community in a positive direction, and we're doing several things to try and achieve that:

we provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to work in AI through our associate and intern programmes
we organise and participate in a range of community events, reading groups and meetups
we produce the AI Australia podcast
we blog about topics we care about
we stream brown bag sessions to the broader community

We make sure you're always one step ahead by investing in and supporting your learning and development, every year. We build our own training where it doesn't exist yet!
We hire smart people and get out of their way. By focusing on our five principles and not getting caught up in red tape, we trust you to get the job done.
You'll get all the tools you need - a new iPhone or Google phone, a new laptop, and a lot of branded swag!

But hold on, you mentioned a house of brands?
 We certainly did! Mantel Group is an Australian-owned, 'house of brands' company with technology businesses (Eliiza being one of them!) across Australia and New Zealand. We're building a group of companies with open borders so we can support you to take on and develop new skills without leaving an awesome team - we know you won't have one job for life!

Building a Uniswap SORA (smart order router agent)

About us
Deeplink is an Ethereum-based deep-learning protocol allowing blockchains to maintain On-chain Neural Networks while introducing programmability, machine learning and on-chain data science into blockchains. In addition, other Ethereum or EVM compatible chains and protocols can use on-chain neural networks and agents to improve efficiency, on-chain execution capabilities and security.
We are true believers in the spirit of crypto and blockchain—of economic Freedom, where everyone should have access to financial freedom. We are big believers in decentralisation, fairness & transparency. We live and breathe in crypto and blockchain 24/7. We are extremely passionate about building open-source tools to innovate. All Deeplink technology, engineering and technical concepts, research, codes, data and product development methodologies are public and open-source.
We believe building developer tools for AI & ML ecosystem to build, test and deploy ML models directly into EVM compatible chains with basic deep learning capabilities will revolutionise the DeFi and many web3 applications, protocols and their ecosystem.
About the use case
Uniswap is the largest decentralised crypto exchange (or DEX) operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap’s average daily trading volume was US$220 million in October 2020, and today, it is responsible for over $1 billion. We estimate by 2024, decentralised exchanges will exceed the centralised exchanges by activities, volume and users.
Uniswap’s large number of activities resulted in random requests, congested transactions, variable Uniswap fees, and variation in Ethereum gas fees. As a result, there are many inefficiencies in the Uniswap protocol/ecosystem. For example, consider a bustling Sunday market where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services whereby things can go incredibly wrong during rush hours. Uniswap traders often spend significant slippage and unnecessary protocol and Ethereum gas fees.
There are three main users/stakeholders;

Traders


LPs (liquidity providers)


The Uniswap project (protocol)

Deeplink v2 is built using deep reinforcement learning to simulate a real-world Uniswap environment/different scenarios (HTR, UTS, low and high supply & demand, high activities). With the vast amount of L3 Atom’s historical and live Uniswap data, Deeplink can simulate different market conditions in parallel. The DRL policy will define inefficiencies and rules. Agents will be punished as they spend more fees when choosing inefficient trade routes.

Machine Learning Manager,Seer,Melbourne VIC,"
About Us
Seer Medical is a Melbourne-based medtech company with an ambitious agenda to challenge the status quo of how healthcare is delivered. Through award-winning medical devices, mobile apps and software solutions combined with an extensive research and development program, we are shifting the patient centre of care from the hospital to the home. 
Our mission is to empower patients and their doctors by creating new care pathways that are entirely free from the inefficiencies of bricks and mortar institutions. Building on our expertise in epilepsy, we are creating end-to-end systems that give people control over their health and put them on a path to better medical outcomes. 
Seer Medical aims to be the global technology leader in home monitoring across neurological, sleep, and cardiac conditions by 2026, and is well on the way to achieving that goal. 
We know this is possible because of the impact Seer Medical has had on how neurology is practised here in Australia. Since 2017, we’ve helped more than 10,000 Australians get the answers they need — cutting waiting times from several months to just a few weeks and diverting more than 100 bed-years away from hospitals. Today, Seer Medical sees more than double the patients requiring video-EEG than all of Australia’s hospitals combined. 
Our international expansion aims to provide: 

improved healthcare access and experiences to patients
objective information to healthcare providers to improve clinical decision-making and care
curated data at an unprecedented scale for future discovery

We will be able to do this through advances in:

mobile, wearable and implantable devices
access to internet, cloud computing and cloud storage
machine learning, data analytics and artificial intelligence

Represent the team across Seer’s Technology organisation, identifying opportunities for ML-based innovation in improving our products or efficiency.
Ensure adoption of best practices including ML design & experimentation, development, deployment & orchestration, and monitoring.
Develop, test, and maintain Python code, ensuring our software is stable, secure, well-documented, tested, and maintainable.
Contribute to the entire development and deployment pipeline from proof-of-concept to model serving & MLOps in the cloud.

Senior Machine Learning Engineer,Nearmap,Barangaroo NSW,"
 Company Description
  AI Model Systems, a team within the AI Systems group at Nearmap, is looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with data systems and machine learning exposure to join the team and contribute to building our next-generation AI Data Platform.  You’ll be designing, building and operating data systems that have access to petabytes of imagery and produce labelled datasets used for training of production quality deep learning models. You will be building systems that tackle the problems with advanced Deep Learning techniques like auto labelling, and data-centric AI. You will work with an incredibly passionate and talented team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers, and your work will interface with systems that run on Kubernetes clusters with thousands of GPUs, train large deep learning models with novel architectures, and produce sophisticated data products for a broad range of customers.



 Job Description
  A typical day will look like this:

 Work within a team to deliver end-to-end technical solutions - writing high quality Python code, scalable micro-services, data pipelines and workflows.
 Talking to all AI team members and data scientists, understanding the long range problems we are trying to solve and devise novel solutions in collaboration with other teams.
 Participating and leading the design and scoping of greenfield projects.




 Qualifications
  Essential:

 Programming/Tech Environments: Ability to code in scientific Python, using a Linux environment and GIT for source control, a keen eye for clean code, and a passion for robustness and correctness.
 Software Engineering: Working on shared codebases to produce production-quality code deployed through well-packaged delivery semantics (conda/PyPI packages and Docker containers).
 Machine Learning: Although we have data scientists who dive deep into the deep learning architectures, as an ML engineer, it is imperative to understand the domain and architect solutions that work for machine learning. Understanding the implications of data systems, and evolutionary architectures and how it is vital to data-centric AI.
 Big Data Systems: Understanding of the implications of scale, volume, latencies, cost and correctness when dealing with big data, using cloud native platforms and techniques.
 Experience with Kubernetes, AWS, Analytical Storage, Event and Queuing technologies, etc. is extremely valuable for this role. Other data engineering and software engineering experience is also desired.
 MLOps: Experience with operationalising ML applications and workflows.
 Scientific Approach: Follow the scientific method of formulating hypotheses, and applying statistical tests to validate them.

 Highly desirable:

 Scale: Working with big data and image datasets, where data sets don’t fit into memory and transformations and computation require multiple nodes to compute efficiently.
 Microservices Architecture: A firm grasp of how to build and design modern scalable and containerised services, and how to deconstruct a complex problem into smaller domains that can be independently iterated and scaled.
 Domain Knowledge: Handling and working with large scale image, and GIS data.
 GP-GPU: Using GPUs to accelerate scientific computing.

 Personal attributes:

 Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of theory and best practices are highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
 Collaboration: Software engineering is a team sport, communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team.
 Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, [click this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4janrzqgfxn61l/test.tar.gz?dl=0) and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).

 Tertiary qualifications: Formal education in a field related to numerical science (Bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, statistics, physics, etc.). Applicants with a Masters/Ph.D. will fit in well within the team, but are by no means necessary — we’re more interested in what you can do!
