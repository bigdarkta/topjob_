What does the role involve?
As a Data Scientist you lead discovery processes to identify the business requirements and business opportunities. To do so, you design experiments, test hypotheses, and you develop and program models. You work in agile, iterative processes, conduct advanced data analysis, and implement highly complex statistical algorithms. In close cooperation with our experienced business analysts you model and frame business scenarios that are meaningful and which affect critical decisions and business processes.  You identify what data is available and relevant, including internal and external data sources, structured and unstructured data, leveraging new data collection processes such as smart meters and connected tool information or social media. You collaborate with global subject matter experts to select the relevant sources of information. You make strategic recommendations on data collection, integration, and retention requirements incorporating business requirements and knowledge of best practices. The development of usage and access control policies and related systems are organized in close alignment with the data steward. Together you drive the continuous improvement processes that are impacting data quality in the context of specific use cases. You present and depict the rationale of your findings in easy-to-understand terms for the business stakeholders and, if applicable, you present back results that contradict common belief to subject matter experts and organizational leadership. You instruct the organization both from IT and the business  perspectives on new approaches, such as testing hypotheses and statistical validation of results. Based on this, you help the organization to understand the principles and the mathematics behind the process to drive organizational buy-in. You provide on-going tracking and monitoring of performance of decision systems and statistical model and  you lead the design and deployment of enhancements and fixes to systems as needed.

Site Reliability Engineer - Mail Delivery,Proton AG,"Remote in Geneva, GE","
A better internet, where privacy is the default, is possible. Building this better internet might seem daunting or even unthinkable, but at Proton, this is what we do every day.

 Proton was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists who met at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Our first product, Proton Mail, is now the world’s largest encrypted email service. Subsequent Proton products, such as Proton VPN, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive, give our users full control over how and with whom their data is shared.  
Today, Proton makes privacy universally accessible. Journalists from outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times, some of the world’s largest organizations, and people in more than 180 countries have signed up for over 70 million accounts. Our diverse and dynamic team is made up of more than 400 members representing over 40 different nationalities. While we are based in Geneva, Switzerland, we have offices in Zurich, Prague, London, Vilnius, Skopje, Taipei, and many more employees working remotely around the world.  
Join one of Europe’s fastest-growing companies to help us solve challenging problems and build new products that will reach hundreds of millions of people. We want to create more than just one of the world’s most impactful tech companies; we want to create a new internet that serves the interests of all people. We need you, your voice, your ideas, and your ambition to make it happen.

 Purpose of the role

 While the open nature of email is great for interoperability, accessibility and freedom from centralized control, it also creates challenging email delivery problems. Any server in the world can send email to any other email server. Many systems must work together at Proton Mail to mitigate spam and virus attacks, do proper authentication to prevent email spoofing, and finally deliver email to the right place. 
You will join a growing mail delivery team to build and operate sophisticated backend systems that send, receive, and filter email. This team contains a mix of senior software engineers and devops/site reliability engineers. 
Your work will directly improve the user experience and digital security of millions of people around the world. You should have extensive experience designing and developing scalable and highly-available systems. 

What you will do 

Improve our mail delivery pipeline (MTA, milters, custom anti-spam systems) 
Improve and monitor delivery statistics 
Protect users against various attacks such as phishing, list bombing, and spoofing 
Automate, deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot critical mail systems


 Software engineering experience with production systems (Python, PHP, C)
 Experienced with Linux and web technologies (DNS, TLS, SMTP) 
Bonus: worked with production mail systems (Postfix, SpamAssassin)



 Why you should join Proton

 Be part of a movement - Proton is not just a product or service but a community-driven movement united by a shared vision of online freedom. Our services are open source, audited, and supported by community contributions. We give back to our community by maintaining core encryption libraries and by supporting other organizations furthering the same goals as us.
 Work with smart and dedicated people - Our team is diverse, collaborative, and tight-knit with people coming from all walks of life, including many of the world’s top academic institutions and organizations, such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Caltech, Cambridge, and ETH. 
Join a strong brand - Our encrypted email service - Proton Mail - has grown to be a staple of online security and privacy. Proton has been featured in multiple popular television and film productions, such as Mr. Robot, Knives Out, Sounds of Metal, and more. 
Grow with us - We’re one of Europe’s fastest-growing startups, doubling in size every year. Our growth gives you limitless career and educational opportunities as well as the opportunity to work side-by-side with many world-leading experts in their fields. 
Have your voice heard - We value your opinion and encourage you to speak up and share your ideas and thoughts. At Proton, no problem is someone else’s problem. We collectively strive to do the right thing and be the undisputed best in the world at everything we do.
 Benefits – these vary by location and type of contract but expect support on your vacation, parental leave, refreshment if working from the office, learning and development opportunities, equity for shared success, flexible working hours and remote work, company events and team building activities.

Intelligent Systems perceive their environment, can learn from the data they collect and adapt to the changing world around them. Intelligent Systems can take many forms. When available, such systems will have profound implications for many areas including manufacturing, transportation, commerce, employment, healthcare, government, legal, security, privacy, and education.
    
 Four integrative research pillars have already been launched since the inception of CIS: “AI for Medicine”, “Intelligent Assistive Robotics”, “Decentralized edge AI Infrastructure” and “Digital Twin”. Furthermore, the EPFL Center for Intelligent Systems supports its 70 associated professors in their teaching and training mission of future engineers/scientists.
    
 In addition, the EPFL CIS serves as a “one-stop-shop” for questions from industry, society and politics on the topics of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics and pro-actively promotes technology transfer from research to society and industry by organizing thematic conferences such as the EPFL Digital Twin Days in November 2021.

BACKGROUND 


IUCN has created a Global Convenings and Events Unit, tasked with organizing the quadrennial IUCN World Conservation Congress as well as annual flagship events, and with supporting other key events internally. These will range from large-scale events, focusing on in-person experience, to fully virtual events. The events fall into 3 broad categories: Every 4 years, the World Conservation Congress brings together the IUCN Members for the Members’ Assembly and a Forum and may be complemented by a large exhibition. The entire Congress is designed as a sustainable and gender-responsive event, and is currently the most widely know among IUCN’s externally-facing events. The next Congress will take place in 2025. IUCN is initiating an annual meeting which will complement the 4-year cycle of the World Conservation Congress with more regular inputs into the international agenda. These meetings will be hosted by different host countries or institutions from the Congress itself. They aim to provide cutting edge information and action relevant to the world’s pressing nature and climate issues. IUCN is a credible and powerful global convener. The Union organises multiple events with varying frequencies and scales. The Global Convenings and Events Unit is responsible for providing both content and logistical support, as well as marketing and outreach capacity to organisers, at a level of service to be agreed upon with the main organising entities.   The Unit liaises with many stakeholders, both in the Secretariat and in the Union’s components such as Commissions and Members. The Convenings Manager is expected to work closely with all of them, coordinating operations for the various categories of events listed above. 


JOB DESCRIPTION 


MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES: The Convenings Manager will report to the Head of the Global Convenings and Events Unit at IUCN Headquarters.

Furthermore, the EPFL Center for Intelligent Systems supports its 70 associated professors in their teaching and training mission of future engineers/scientists. In addition, the EPFL CIS serves as a ""one-stop-shop"" for questions from industry, society and politics on the topics of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics and pro-actively promotes technology transfer from research to society and industry by organizing thematic conferences such as the EPFL Digital Twin Days in November 2021.

Doctoral position: FishPath - Turbulent eddies to create pat...,ETH Zürich,"8092 Zürich, ZH","


Water and ice are our passion at the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology (VAW), in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (D-BAUG) at ETH Zurich. We work in the domains of hydraulic engineering and structures, river engineering, numerical modelling, and glaciology. Our fields of activity are inland waters, hydropower, glaciers, natural hazards, river restoration, and river infrastructure. We contribute to the availability of clean and renewable electricity, to the protection against floods and cryospheric hazards, and to sustainable watercourses.

Project background

The FishPath project aims at developing cost-effective measures for safe downstream passage for important fish species at hydropower structures. The novel idea is that knowledge on fish behavioural responses to turbulent eddies can be used to develop guidance systems that create alternative migration pathways for fish around hydropower plants and other water intakes. To this end, the project investigates interactions between fish and turbulent eddies created by innovative elements at small-to-large scales, develops turbulent Eddies-based behavioural fish Guidance Systems (EGS) based on a combination of such elements and finally provides a manual for cost-effective design, implementation and maintenance of EGS for safe downstream fish passage at intakes. The target fish species are Atlantic salmon, trout and European eel.
The inter-, transdisciplinary and multinational FishPath project represents an unique research team (NINA, NTNU, VAW of ETH Zurich, SINTEF, NORCE & FishConsulting) in collaboration with partners from Sweden, Denmark and USA.
This job opening is for a PhD project embedded in the FishPath work package of EGS development at ETH Zurich. The PhD student will work in close collaboration with mainly FishConsulting, NINA and other project partners.

Job description

The PhD project consists of five main tasks linked to the work packages and overarching goals of FishPath. Task A is devoted to hydraulic and live fish tests of single innovative structural elements in a small laboratory flume, while Task B focusses on hydraulic and live-fish tests of optimal EGS configurations in a large etho-hydraulic flume. Task C investigates operational aspects of EGS such as clogging by sediment and floating debris. In Task D, hydraulic and live-fish tests of the optimized EGS will be conducted with the partners in a semi-natural flume in the Vattenfall laboratory, Sweden, in the 3rd year of the project for 5 weeks. Finally, Task E will contribute to the development of a design manual for EGS. In the laboratory tests at VAW, Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and potentially Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) will be used to measure flow velocities and two different video-based 3D fish tracking systems are employed to determine fish tracks and concomitant swimming kinematics. Hydraulic and fish data will be analyzed to investigate the effect of turbulent eddies created by the different EGS on the swimming behaviour of target fish species and determine the fish guidance performance of the EGS under various flow conditions. Live-fish tests will be conducted at VAW in collaboration with the Swiss project partner of FishConsulting. Strong Python (mainly) and MATLAB coding for camera calibration, image analysis and animal tracking and data analysis skills are required for the position.
The successful candidate will conduct the research activities defined in the five tasks of the project, participate in project meetings in Norway and on-line, publish the research results in scientific journals and present them at international conferences. The candidate will take fish handling courses to conduct live-fish tests in the laboratory and other courses required in the scope of the doctorate at ETH Zurich (total of 12 ECTS).
The starting date is the beginning of October or November 2022. The planned project duration is 4 years. The student will be jointly supervised by Dr. Ismail Albayrak (main supervisor) and Prof. Dr. Robert Boes.

Your profile


Excellent Master's degree in civil or environmental engineering (or equivalent), with a specialization in hydraulic engineering
Demonstrated background in hydraulic experimentation (PIV, ADV), ability and willingness to work mainly in a hydraulic laboratory and partly in the field (fish collection)
Knowledge in coding and advanced data analysis (Python as well as MATLAB for image processing and R for statistical data analysis)
Willingness to conduct live-fish tests at night in Autumn seasons
Optimally background knowledge of applied fish biology or fish migration
Highly motivated, committed, and creative candidate with outstanding organization and communication skills, able to work within an international team of scientists from various disciplines and stakeholders
Proficient command of the English language, written and spoken
German knowledge is an asset
No travel restrictions since this position requires some weeks of work in Sweden and the participation in project meetings in Norway

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join a team of researchers studying the influence of child gut microbiota on development of metabolic-related disorders.


  Project
 

  The symbiotic microorganisms colonize all mucosal body surfaces of newborns and play a key role in shaping the development and maturation of immune system. In the intestine, the first vigorous immune response to colonizing bacteria after birth occurs at weaning. This response termed ""weaning reaction"" is critical for generating an immune memory that prevents the susceptibility to multiple inflammatory pathologies in adult mice (Al Nabhani et al., Immunity 2019, Nature Metabolism 2019). In the framework of ERC starting project, we are seeking to gain knowledge regarding the microbiological mechanisms that affect the induction of the weaning reaction. The project will involve cultivation of bacteria and fungi under controlled laboratory conditions, incubating with stable isotope tracers, and conducting biogeochemical and molecular biology (metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) analyses. In this role you will: analyze interactions between host and microbial symbionts (fungal and bacterial); contribute to the conception, design, and execution of research to address questions in host-microbial interactions; collaborate with other scientists and technical personnel; perform independent research and lead new projects in the area of gut microbiome research and mouse experimentation.
  
 The post-holder will be supported by a well-funded interdisciplinary research program in a young and dynamic environment at the Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, and at the Department of Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Inselspital Bern, Switzerland. We work closely with groups of Prof. Andrew Macpherson and Prof. Stephanie Ganal-Vonarburg, and we are involved in joint lab meetings and journal clubs. We are now developing an international and national collaborative network in which the postdoc will be involved.
  
 We are requesting candidates to please explain work related experience around the topics below within submitted Cover Letter:
  

Experience in designing, running, and analyzing data from microbial ecology studies
Experience with bioinformatics and statistical analyses of metabolic pathways, functional gene patterns and microbial community assembly




Required Minimum Qualifications
 The candidate should have a strong interest in gut microbiota and mucosal immunology and a PhD degree by the time that they start the job.
  

Preferred Qualifications


Experience with cultivation techniques for fungal, or bacterial interactions studies
Publication record in the peer-reviewed literature reflecting intellectual leadership and scientific creativity
Demonstrated ability as an independent and innovative experimentalist
Experience analyzing 'omics datasets (metagenome, metatranscriptome, or metabolomics)


Our offers

  We provide excellent scientific opportunities in a highly motivating environment with a multidisciplinary approach to microbial ecology and mucosal immunology discussions as well as seminars with wide-range topics. The project offers a special opportunity to be trained on experimental immunology using germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse models. We offer close supervision with ample support and interesting discussions. We support also participation in international and national research conferences. We assist postdoc for an independent global scientific career through and after the project.

 RAW Labs is funded by a group of highly sophisticated and experienced technology investors and are advised by technology luminaries including: Prof. Martin Odersky (creator of Scala), Prof. Mike Franklin (co-creator of Spark), Dr. Alon Halevy (from Facebook’s AI team).
 Where you'll be
 Our R&D team is based in two development centers: one in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the other in Athens, Greece. The successful applicants will be working in/near either office, with Remote working available if desired by agreement - note that access to either office will be required for face-to-face meetings with your project supervisor.
 Requirements
 Firstly and foremostly, we are looking for candidates with a passion for new technology, an inquisitive mind, a self-starting approach, and a can-do attitude. You may be working on problems that may not have been solved yet, or only partially solved. We are looking for:

 Masters' candidates only.
 Commercial experience a benefit, not a pre-requisite.
 Evidence of an innovative project you have undertaken in the software and/or data space.
 Great oral and written communication skills, preferably in English, but we have French, Greek and Portuguese speakers too.

 For technical skills, we can tailor the project to the successful candidate's experience. Here are some of the technologies we use currently:

 Scala and/or Java and/or Kotlin, and SQL.
 Development of distributed / big data, especially Spark
 Development of Visual Studio Code Extensions
 Cloud Service Provider's stack, e.g: AWS
 Benchmarking and profiling tools, e.g., JMH, Apache JMeter
 Container technologies such as Kubernetes and/or Docker
 CI/CD tools, e.g., Jenkins, Artifactory and DevOps tooling, e.g., Terraform, Docker, Compose, Ansible
 Security frameworks/libraries/providers, e.g. Auth0


 Our Projects
 Please indicate in your application which of the projects are of interest to you.
 1. GraalVM/Truffle code generator
 For Whom: Students interested into gaining hands-on into compilers and database architecture. Duration: Flexible, but min. of 3 months. Ideally 6 to 12 months.
 RAW’s query engine implements just-in-time code generation techniques, and additionally supports multiple experimental code emitters. The goal of this internship is to contribute to an experimental Truffle-based code generator for the RAW query engine.
 This project requires knowledge of Java and basic knowledge of compiler design (e.g. university course on compilers). Database engine design knowledge is desirable. Experience in – or strong desired to learn - GraalVM and Truffle in particular are a big plus, so please mention it.
 We provide learning material, so above all, this project requires willingness to learn, implement and experiment.
 2. AI/ML for Schema Discovery
 For Whom: Students interested into gaining hands-on experience in the development of practical AI/ML models. Duration: Flexible. Expect 2 to 6 months.
 A major feature of RAW’s query engine is the ability to read “raw” data (CSV, XML, JSONs, etc) with complex structures, directly from source and without any previous processing. Among other features, this requires a complex schema detection framework. For this we have developed an inferrer.
 The goal of this project is to advance the use of AI/ML techniques for the inferrer to detect the structure and schema of typical datasets in a performant matter, e.g. character encoding, headers, delimiters, data types, formats of dates, numbers, nulls, etc. It is an opportunity to develop novel techniques, which may lay the foundation for future research-level work. This project requires previous experience in building AI/ML models. No specific toolchain is required. Above all, this project requires a deep interest in the development and experimentation of new techniques as well as its careful evaluation.

Postdoctoral Researcher for Rare Disease Diagnosis using Mac...,ETH Zürich,"8092 Zürich, ZH","


The University Children's Hospital Zurich and the Department of Computer Science ETH are looking for a joint Postdoctoral Researcher starting by agreement.

Project background

Rare diseases affect 400 million people worldwide, and about 500,000 in Switzerland. Due to their usually early onset, rare diseases predominantly affect children. Children with rare diseases may present in any setting but are found at increased rates in critically ill neonates or children admitted to intensive care units. Since many children with rare diseases remain undiagnosed, our goal is to combine clinical evaluation (to characterize the extreme phenotypes) with multi-omics exploration (to delineate the underlying genetic and molecular alterations) to identify rare diseases in critically ill children. This project is integrated in the Swiss-wide National Data Stream “SwissPedHealth”, funded by the Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) strategic focus area of the ETH, and the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN).

Job description

The candidate will work at the interface of the Children’s Hospital and the ETH to use machine learning for rare disease diagnosis. The main responsibility will be to implement state-of-the-art and develop novel machine learning algorithms to integrate multi-omics and clinical phenotype data. They will work with computer science, biology and clinical teams to use existing multi-omic and clinical data to train a multimodal model which identifies features that are most important for the prediction. The goal will be to develop new methods suited for rare disease diagnostics, especially for data with a low sample size but high dimensionality, to be implemented in prospective patients.

Your profile

The highly motivated candidate will

have already obtained a PhD in Computer Science, Computational Biology, Medical Informatics or a related field
have experience in at least one of: machine learning (including deep learning), computational genomics and complex data engineering at scale
have excellent communication skills (written and verbal) in English and be enthusiastic about working in a highly interdisciplinary environment of computer scientists, biologists and clinicians
have a strong research track record

The successful candidate will ideally

solid experience in software development, ideally in Python and C/C++
have prior experience with multi-omics data integration
have an interest in rare disease and clinical translation
be driven, goal- and team-oriented


Your workplace

We offer

We offer a competitive employment package, as well as a supportive and highly collaborative working environment that fosters academic career development. The University Children’s Hospital is the largest university children's hospital in Switzerland with about 2,500 employees, and is one of the leading centres for paediatric and youth medicine in Europe.

Postdoc position in advanced lung disease research,Department of Thoracic Surgery,"Zürich, ZH","

Department of Thoracic Surgery
Postdoc position in advanced lung disease research 80-100 % The Department of Thoracic Surgery is looking for a highly motivated and flexible postdoctoral research fellow for our research projects into advanced lung diseases, and in particular Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH).
   In addition to being one of two centres performing lung transplantation in Switzerland, we are the only centre in Switzerland offering the only curative treatment, surgical resection, for patients suffering from this rare and debilitating lung disease. CTEPH is characterized by bilateral obstruction of the pulmonary arteries, resulting in progressive dyspnea and ultimately in right heart failure.
   Despite some recent studies, the molecular basis and the underlying pathophysiology of CTEPH to date remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding is preventing early diagnosis, and hindering the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for patients not eligible for surgery.
   To address these shortcomings, we are undertaking a comprehensive research project aimed at gaining a better understanding of the pathophysiology through multi-omics profiling (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics). In addition, we are establishing primary cell culture models for further hypothesis testing, e.g. new targets identified as part of the multi omics profiling. 
 

Your responsibilities As postdoctoral research fellow, the successful candidate will be responsible for planning and execution of the overall project. In terms of experimental tasks, you will be responsible for the transcriptomic analyses and the primary cell culture parts of this project, including establishment and validation of primary cell cultures.
   In addition, you will support the clinic director and the research coordinator in supervision of the PhD student currently working on the genomics part, as well as master students undertaking smaller parts of the project. 
 

Your profile Upon start, applicants must hold a PhD in biology, or a related science field, preferably with expertise in the field of cardiovascular disease or pulmonary hypertension.
   You are an enthusiastic scientist with demonstrated track record in standard cell and molecular biology techniques.
   Specific qualifications include:
  
 Experience in cell culture and standard molecular biology techniques (extraction of nucleic acids, qPCR, Western Blotting, ELISA, FACS, etc)
 Experience with bioinformatics analysis of omics data and biostatistics is highly desired
 Ability to work independently
 Strong motivation to learn and establish new protocols and methods
 Excellent English communication skills including writing of scientific manuscripts, reports, abstracts and scientific presentations are mandatory. Knowledge of German is a plus, yet not mandatory
 A high degree of flexibility and dedication to the project will be mandatory



What we offer We are offering a highly original and translational research project addressing unmet clinical needs of CTEPH. You will be working in a team of young and highly motivated colleagues with experience in translational and clinical research, and will be provided with an excellent supporting environment and infrastructure. The position is on an annual contract with possible extension depending on availability of funding. Diversity and inclusion are important to us.

Postdoc Position: Infant intestinal microbiota,Universität Bern Universität Bern,"Bern, BE","


Postdoc Position: Infant intestinal microbiota

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join a team of researchers studying the influence of child gut microbiota on development of metabolic-related disorders.


   Project
  

   The symbiotic microorganisms colonize all mucosal body surfaces of newborns and play a key role in shaping the development and maturation of immune system. In the intestine, the first vigorous immune response to colonizing bacteria after birth occurs at weaning. This response termed ""weaning reaction"" is critical for generating an immune memory that prevents the susceptibility to multiple inflammatory pathologies in adult mice (Al Nabhani et al., Immunity 2019, Nature Metabolism 2019). In the framework of ERC starting project, we are seeking to gain knowledge regarding the microbiological mechanisms that affect the induction of the weaning reaction. The project will involve cultivation of bacteria and fungi under controlled laboratory conditions, incubating with stable isotope tracers, and conducting biogeochemical and molecular biology (metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) analyses. In this role you will: analyze interactions between host and microbial symbionts (fungal and bacterial); contribute to the conception, design, and execution of research to address questions in host-microbial interactions; collaborate with other scientists and technical personnel; perform independent research and lead new projects in the area of gut microbiome research and mouse experimentation.
   
 The post-holder will be supported by a well-funded interdisciplinary research program in a young and dynamic environment at the Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, and at the Department of Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Inselspital Bern, Switzerland. We work closely with groups of Prof. Andrew Macpherson and Prof. Stephanie Ganal-Vonarburg, and we are involved in joint lab meetings and journal clubs. We are now developing an international and national collaborative network in which the postdoc will be involved.
   
 We are requesting candidates to please explain work related experience around the topics below within submitted Cover Letter:
   

Experience in designing, running, and analyzing data from microbial ecology studies
Experience with bioinformatics and statistical analyses of metabolic pathways, functional gene patterns and microbial community assembly




Required Minimum Qualifications
 The candidate should have a strong interest in gut microbiota and mucosal immunology and a PhD degree by the time that they start the job.
   

Preferred Qualifications


Experience with cultivation techniques for fungal, or bacterial interactions studies
Publication record in the peer-reviewed literature reflecting intellectual leadership and scientific creativity
Demonstrated ability as an independent and innovative experimentalist
Experience analyzing 'omics datasets (metagenome, metatranscriptome, or metabolomics)



   Our offers
  

   We provide excellent scientific opportunities in a highly motivating environment with a multidisciplinary approach to microbial ecology and mucosal immunology discussions as well as seminars with wide-range topics. The project offers a special opportunity to be trained on experimental immunology using germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse models. We offer close supervision with ample support and interesting discussions. We support also participation in international and national research conferences. We assist postdoc for an independent global scientific career through and after the project.
   

Starting date: October 2022 or on agreement
   
Duration: 2-4 years
  

   Application Contact
  

   Please send your application before September 30th, 2022, including a short letter of interest, curriculum vitae with description of your professional experience, a list of publications, a list of 2 contact referees or their references letter as a single pdf-file by email to:

 About RMS
 There is a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks-from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we are on a mission to help make every risk known.
 Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.
