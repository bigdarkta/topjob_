Junior Associate,McKinsey & Company,"Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires","


Who You'll Work With

    You will be based in our Buenos Aires location, as part of our our Spanish LatAm office. You will work on the best teams to help the best organizations in the world - in private, public, and social sectors - solve their most difficult problems. You will also work with many experts, from data scientists and researchers to software and app designers.
   




What You'll Do


     You’ll work in teams of typically 3 - 5 consultants, playing an active role in all aspects of client engagement.
    


      This includes gathering and analyzing information, formulating and testing hypotheses, and developing and communicating recommendations. You’ll also have the opportunity to present results to client management and implement recommendations in collaboration with client team members.
    


      You will receive exceptional training as well as frequent coaching and mentoring from colleagues on their teams. This support includes a partner from your local office or practice assigned to you to help guide your career as well as up to five weeks of formal training in your first few years. Additionally, you’ll receive guidance and support from your local office or practice in the selection of client projects, helping you to develop your skills and build your network.
    


      While all consultants develop specialized knowledge and a focused program as they progress with McKinsey, most are initially very broad in their focus, meaning they do not need specific industry or functional expertise to be successful. For consultants who join McKinsey as experienced professionals, this can mean building on previous knowledge or developing unique experience in an area that is completely new.

Staff Software Engineer (Tools and Data Science Group),Proofpoint,"Córdoba, Córdoba","

  It's fun to work in a company where people truly BELIEVE in what they're doing!
 


 We're committed to bringing passion and customer focus to the business.



   The Role
 


   As a Staff Software Engineer, you will work with internal users such as threat analysts, other developers and data scientists to create new tools and extend existing tools which mine data in a variety of formats and network locations to present useful information.
 


   This job is an opportunity to create mechanisms to better understand how the people that we are responsible for protecting are being targeted by bad actors across the globe. With your help, we can advance our state-of-the-art protection mechanisms and keep ahead of an ever-changing threat landscape.
 


 Your day-to-day
 

 The Staff Software Engineers in the tool & data science group are responsible for creating tools for analyzing and presenting a large and disparate set of real-world data to determine what types of threats are affecting our customers.
 One must have an inquisitive mind with the ability to learn where the data exists in a large and disparate system and what that data means.
 One will hone their ability to create tools that programmatically turn data into usable information.



   What you bring to the team
 

 Recent hands-on experience with working with Javascript/React. We have other engineers who can help frame out front-ends, but you may still be involved in creating or extending front-ends for your services.
 Recent hands-on experience with at least one NoSQL database (e.g. MongoDB, ElasticSearch) required. We work with a wide variety of internal users, and this job is hands-on. So one day you’ll be meeting with a senior threat intelligence researcher to better understand what we need to build in order to better meet those needs. The next day, you might be writing and releasing code to make some part of our data newly visible to threat analysts.
 3+ years with writing Javascript code for applications running in a public cloud environment.
 BSCS or greater in relevant technical field with 7 years of experience , or 9+ years experience in a similar role.
 Recent hands-on experience with relational databases and SQL (MariaDB, MySQL, etc.) required.
 Recent hands-on experience with AWS serverless computing (including SQS/Lambda pipelines and Glue/Spark) not required but very helpful. As you do your work, you’ll have access to the full range of tools that Amazon and other public cloud providers are creating to rapidly analyze and visualize terabytes of complex threat metadata.
 Willingness and ability to create and extend test frameworks around the code you write to prevent regressions and identify design flaws.
