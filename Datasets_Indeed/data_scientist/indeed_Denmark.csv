Senior Data Scientist,Maersk,København,"



   Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!
  


    You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?
  


    Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
  


    But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?
  


    Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data is part of our mission.
  


    We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
  


    We’re looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join an already big family of Teams that consist of Data Scientists and Software Engineers working together to process, analyze and make models from the large amount of data coming in from ships. The ambition is high, and it’s the engine of every advice we give the seafarers.
  


    We offer.
  


    Joining Maersk will embark you on a great journey with career development in a global organization. You will gain broad business knowledge of the company’s activities globally, as well as understand how the complexity of IT supports the transport and logistics
    business.
   
 At Maersk we value the diversity of our talent and will always strive to recruit the best person for the job – we value diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to: gender, age, nationality, race, sexual orientation, disability or religious beliefs.
   
 We are proud of our diversity and see it as a genuine source of strength for building high performing teams
  




    Key responsibilities.
  


    Your main responsibility is to develop, test, and deploy data science solutions together with the team. These can vary from dashboards to machine learning models.
   
 As a Senior Data Scientist in the team, you are expected to also pitch in on Product, Data Engineering and Software Engineering tasks. We have a team culture where everyone contributes when they can which leads to more “full-stack” roles.
   
 Do you think our current implementation of something is not as it should be? Take ownership and make a pull request to fix it! :)
   
 Adding new features, and making changes to our data pipeline (spark, python, deployed on Kubernetes) that joins billions of sensor readings with weather and operational data.
   
 Working with the Software Engineers on ensuring the models provide real world value, whether this will be through a simple endpoint in our API, or as part of an optimization algorithm which could be anything from a simple binary search to dynamic programming.
   
 Collaborate with the Product Owners on new opportunities for improving our applications to get happier users and a greener fleet.
  




    We are looking for.
  


    A self-motivated person who likes working in an agile manner and have excellent communication and teamwork skills. You must enjoy learning, sharing, and taking part in our weekly team training sessions where we read books and take courses together.
   
 You enjoy tackling unfamiliar problems and engaging with coworkers from around the organization as well as diving into new technical challenges. Our working language is English, and you should be fluent.
  

 Substantial experience in a similar position, working with data science solutions, ideally in a product setting, where you have learned to balance speed and quality in the development process.
   
 Great understanding of machine learning and statistics is required.
  

 Experience of working with agile software engineering practices such asDevOps, DataOps or MLOps.
   
 Strong skillset in SQL and python. Most of our code base is built in python, with PySpark doing some of the heavy lifting in the data pipeline.
   
 Ability to communicate findings to both peers and business stakeholders.
   
 Background in statistics, mathematics, computer science, engineering or similar.

   Statistics (advanced) 
    Data analysis (advanced) 
    Data (advanced) 
    Python (advanced)
  


    Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.
    


     One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our first product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible with minimal engineering overhead to both humans and machine-learning models in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.
    


     We
    


 are allergic to over-engineering.
 are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
 are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
 are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
 have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).


 As an early member of our data science team, you will help
    


 push the limits of what can be done with data.
 build the team and drive the direction of the company.
 shape our product and culture.
 experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.


 The following are required
    


 the tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.
 Spark, SQL and fundamental database operations.
 recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
 fluency in statistics and probability.


     FAQ
    


     What if I recommend someone who ends up getting hired?
    


     We will give you 20k USD for the referral.
    


     Where is Ntropy located?
    


     We are fully remote, with a virtual base in New York, US.
    


     What time-zones do you work with?
    


     We hire anywhere in GMT-7 to GMT+1.
    


     Do you consider part-time work?
    


     Not at the moment. Full-time roles only.
    


     How are you funded?
    


     We are backed by some of the top fintech investors in the world. Have raised single-digit millions of dollars so far. Can share more details over the call.
    


     Do you already have a product?
    


     Yes. In production since 1st April 2021.
    


     Do you plan to sell customer data?
    


     Ntropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers. We will never sell customer data and will always put privacy and customer benefit ahead of any auxiliary financial gains.
    


     What is the interview process like?
    


 Send us problems you have solved before and how. Please include as much detail as possible: code, algorithms, derivations, proofs, etc. We will then do a video call to kick things off and go through it (45 mins). 
 We will give you a take-home project related to whatever we are currently working on (3-4 hours). Alternatively, if you have a relevant project that you worked on previously that demonstrates your skills as an engineer, you are welcome to use that instead. 
 We will then do a deep-dive through the project over a call and discuss the implementation, improvements and bottlenecks. 


     Above all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are at during the whole process.
    


     What are your hiring plans?
    


     We aim to be 22-25 people in the next 6 months. Mostly engineering roles.
    


     What is your current stack?
    


     back-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters)
     compute - AWS + Azure
     ML - PyTorch + ONNX
    


     Work / life balance?
    


     We are a startup which requires you to put in a lot more work and soul than a regular job. It will require long hours and sacrificing your free time. We believe, however, that nothing easy is worth doing. We will expect a lot from you, and you should expect a lot from us.

  in vivo models to address key questions on understanding the role of adaptive and innate immune system in neurological disorders. A key aspect of our group’s mission is to support discovery projects by providing biomarker data to support PKPD understanding and facilitate decision making in our discovery programs. Therefore, an important part of the job is to run biochemical analysis of tissue samples with ligand binding assays (e.g. ELISA, Mesoscale or Gyrolab).
 



  Furthermore, you will serve on cross-functional project teams, where you will be expected to contribute biological and pharmacological insights to projects, and there are opportunities to initiate and develop ideas for new therapeutic programs. Besides the studies performed in-house with internal stakeholders, you will be expected to direct studies through external partners such as CROs and vendors to support outsourced activities. You will work closely with other scientists in the team and in close collaboration with the other technicians and scientists in the Pathology, Circuits and Symptoms area as well as in the department of Biotherapeutic Discovery, contributing to the collaborative, friendly, fast paced, and innovative environment in Lundbeck Neuroscience
 



Preferred Qualifications


Our preferred candidate has the following professional and personal qualifications:


PhD degree in Neuroimmunology, Neuroscience, or related areas, with 1-3 years post-PhD experience.
Experience with Drug discovery, Pharma, Biotech, or leading biomarker development will be an advantage, as is familiarity with concepts of PK, PKPD and translational pharmacology.
Experience with developing and working with mechanistic (animal) models of neuromuscular and neuroimmune disorders (e.g., ALS, MS, HD, autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and autoimmune myopathy is highly desirable.

Experience with Flow Cytometry based analysis (i.e., whole blood/PBMC, FACS, microRNAs, macrovesicles (MVs) and exosomes), or neuroinflammation related immunoassays will be advantageous.
Experience of metabolomic biomarkers will be advantageous.

Strong statistical analysis skills and an ability to articulate conclusions and recommendations from complex study results.
Experience working within cross-functional project teams, and a track record of successful collaboration with internal or external teams at contract research organizations and academic laboratories.
Strong effective communication skills with demonstrated ability to deliver presentations in a broad range of settings.

We work with a very rapid release schedule, often releasing multiple times per day. This gives us a quick and motivating feedback loop. This also makes it very easy for a developer to see their effect on business! This allows us to experiment and adopt new trends/frameworks quickly.

  As part of the digitalisation of early research at Novo Nordisk we are looking for an outstanding candidate with a strong background in computational science and natural language processing (NLP) who can bring value to the organisation by turning text into data for analysis and insights, via application of NLP and analytical methods.
  
 This is an exciting position where you will help scientists in the early research organisation to transform their decision-making from a document-centric view of finding documents and reading them, to a data-centric view of uncovering new insights by the use of natural language processing-based text mining. This will help the researchers to overcome the limitations of unstructured data and uncover previously hidden relationships. 
  
 This is your chance to join forces with a competent information research department and help democratize external and internal scientific information and data. The position offers you a unique combination of science and information research. 
  
 About the department and area
  
 You will join 20 dedicated colleagues within the Novo Nordisk Global Information and Analysis department (GLIA), which offers a worldwide information service and scientific intelligence function to Research & Early Development (R&ED), at headquarter and affiliates.
  
 Our purpose is to provide modern digital solutions to the organisation and to ensure that internal customers have easy and global access to quality information sources and professional information research services supporting their needs. 
  
 GLIA is part of a new area, Digital Research & Intelligence (DRI), which is being established to provide a modern scientific intelligence unit, drive external collaborations and access to emerging technologies in the digital space of drug discovery, facilitate idea maturation and develop an educational framework to drive our digital journey.
  
 Digital & Research Intelligence is part of Digital Science & Innovation (DSI), which was recently established to drive digitalisation across R&ED. DSI participates in drug development projects across the value chain, from early discovery to pre-clinical development.
  
 The position

Data Specialist,Wilke,Aarhus,"

Vil du arbejde for en af Danmarks førende konsulent- og analysevirksomheder, hvor vi hver dag løser spændende opgaver for en bred vifte af virksomheder i såvel Danmark som udlandet? Er du typen, der elsker at arbejde med data og brænder for at skabe digitale løsninger til at forbedre forretningsprocesser – så kan du meget vel passe perfekt ind hos os i Wilke!

 Vi søger en data specialist til vores Digital Solutions afdeling i Aarhus, Odense eller København, som har flair for data management, analyse og projektledelse, og som kan bidrage til at udvikle og vedligeholde Wilkes digitale løsninger i fremtiden.

 Du vil bidrage til at definere og udvikle vores løsninger helt fra idé til færdigt produkt, og du vil også få ansvar for selve udviklingen af de konkrete løsninger, samt implementere og styre en række af vores udviklingsprojekter, fx inden for machine learning, systemarkitektur, databaseoptimering eller nye analysemetoder. Her vil du få mulighed for at arbejde tæt sammen med en række af Danmarks dygtigste virksomheder på digitale projekter hvor innovation og data er centrale dele af løsningen.

 Din rolle i Digital Solutions
 Vi er et mindre, sammentømret team i en større organisation, og du vil derfor få mulighed for mange berøringsflader og for at sætte et stort præg på vores projekter. Samtidig er et af vores mantraer, at man arbejder bedst, der hvor man har det sjovest, og derfor går vi meget op i at fordele opgaver efter interesser. For dig kunne det måske være systemarkitektur og API integrationer, machine-learning projekter til churn prediction, automatisering af datapipelines eller opsætning af dashboards på større dataindsamlinger.

 I det daglige vil din rolle være som ansvarlig frontperson på flere af vores større projekter. Vores projekter er ofte videnstunge med mange interessenter, hvor innovation og god projektledelse skal gå op i en højere enhed, for at lykkes med projektet.

 Hvem er du?
 Der er mange veje til stillingen som data specialist, da vi lægger stor vægt på dine personlige kompetencer, og derfor er vi åbne over for mange forskellige baggrunde. Det er dog centralt, at du har digitalt flair og har gode kompetencer inden for IT og data. Det kan fx være, at du arbejder som data scientist, BI-konsulent eller lignende.

 På det personlige plan elsker du struktur, og er typen der gør en dyd ud af at være detaljeorienteret. Du bliver motiveret af at sætte ting i system, og samtidig at finde system i de ting, der ikke umiddelbart er som de skal være. Du har god erfaring med projektledelse og forstår at planlægning og opfølgning er centrale elementer i at nå sine mål.

 Stillingen som data specialist er en senior stilling, og vi forventer derfor at du har flere års erhvervserfaring, som du kan bringe i spil.

 Erfaring med nedenstående vil give dig et godt afsæt:

 Systemarkitektur
 API integrationer til BI systemer, telesystemer og CRM systemer
 Indgående kendskab til dashboards i PowerBI eller Tableau
 Dataanalyse, herunder gode statistikkundskaber
 Erfaring med programmeringssprog, fx C#, Python, R m.fl.

 Hvem er vi?
 Wilke er en dansk rådgivnings- og analysevirksomhed, der hjælper virksomheder og organisationer med at skabe vækst gennem værdifulde indsigter. Vi har gennem de seneste år arbejdet for nogle af Danmarks største virksomheder og fokuserer på at skabe brugbare svar, løsninger og muligheder for vores kunder, frem for rapporter der samler støv.
 I Digital Solutions teamet bliver du en del af et bredt fagligt miljø, hvor der bliver sat en ære i at lave fede ting. Vi vægter højt til loftet og en afslappet tone, hvor alles dør altid står åben (vi har faktisk nærmest ingen døre). Godt humør, plads til personlighed og ansvar er centrale i vores kultur, og vi går op i at komme hinanden ved.

 Interesseret?
 Har du lyst til at blive en del af holdet, så send din ansøgning og CV via stillingsopslaget på job.wilke.dk. Har du spørgsmål, er du velkommen til at kontakte Martin Jacobsen, mja@wilke.dk / 61 68 87 48.

 Vi holder samtaler løbende, og besætter stillingen hurtigst muligt, så vent ikke med at sende din ansøgning.

 Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!

Vi er virkelig gode til modellering og statistik, og vi har brug for en, der vil være med på holdet til vores state of the art løsninger. Hen over efteråret idriftsætter vi flere strategisk vigtige modeller inden for anti-hvidvask og marketing. Vi vil være ét BI & Data Science team, der ejer hele dataproduktet – fra kilde til indsigt. Vi har et unikt datasæt, både i omfang og kvalitet, og vi brænder for at bruge det aktivt til ansvarlige og fornuftige løsninger.


Dig og dine opgaver
Vi leverer på tværs af afdelinger i Danske Spil, så du kommer rundt i organisationen. Du vil i dit daglige arbejde som Data Scientist have fokus på at skabe modeller, der giver værdi for forretningen.
Vores arbejde er meget projektorienteret med en stor grad af frihed, hvor løbende vedligehold i teamet er forventelig i mindre grad. Dine opgaver vil blandt andet være:

Udvikle og sparre om modeller, der kan bruges aktivt i forretningen
Kommunikere modellers performance og bagvedliggende metode bredt i organisationen
Arbejde iterativt og agilt med et ”Fail fast”-mindset

Vi forestiller os, at du har et par års erfaring eller er nyuddannet indenfor data science. Vi forventer, at du har erfaring med at kode i Python. Din rolle vil være som udførende Data Scientist, hvor du vil have berøringsflader med alle opgavetyper i data science. Det er derfor vigtigt at du:

Vil alle aspekter af data science – både det forretningsorienterede og det tekniske
Trives med at drive projekter fremad og fjerne forhindringer som de opstår
Er god til at arbejde struktureret og have øje på bolden

Derudover er det en fordel, hvis du synes sport og spil er sjovt, da det ligger dybt i Danske Spils DNA.


Vi gider dig! Gider du os?
Vi er to teams, der netop er blevet slået sammen. På din første dag, vil du møde os som Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Business Partners, Product Owners, Tech Lead og Team Lead. Selvom vi har smarte titler, er vi ret jordnære og bruger en del tid på at diskutere det korrekte frokosttidspunkt. Vi er et socialt team med både introverte og ekstroverte profiler, og dog et godt sammenhold; vi har lige vundet vores interne fodboldturnering, går gerne sent hjem fra sommerfest og spiser gerne kage et par gange om ugen – typisk foranlediget af et væddemål initieret af en eller anden faglig diskussion. Vi er en blandet flok data-, brætspils-, sports- og serienørder, hvor de fleste af os prioriterer familie og os selv ret højt.
Skriv eller ansøg direkte, hvis du vil give os lidt mere end nogle minutter af din tid.
Du starter ansøgningsprocessen ved at klikke på ”Søg stillingen”. Send din ansøgning, så vi har den senest den 31. august. Vi holder samtaler løbende, så send gerne din ansøgning afsted hurtigst muligt. Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Trine Brandt på tbra@danskespil.dk. Hvis du har spørgsmål til rekrutteringsprocessen, er du velkommen til at kontakte HR Business Partner, Majbritt Storm Balslev på masb@danskespil.dk

Senior Data Scientist - Decarbonization,Apm Terminals,København,"

Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!
 You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?
 Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
 But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?
 Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data is part of our mission.
 We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
 We’re looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join an already big family of Teams that consist of Data Scientists and Software Engineers working together to process, analyze and make models from the large amount of data coming in from ships. The ambition is high, and it’s the engine of every advice we give the seafarers.
 We offer. Joining Maersk will embark you on a great journey with career development in a global organization. You will gain broad business knowledge of the company’s activities globally, as well as understand how the complexity of IT supports the transport and logistics
  business.
 
 At Maersk we value the diversity of our talent and will always strive to recruit the best person for the job – we value diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to: gender, age, nationality, race, sexual orientation, disability or religious beliefs.
 
 We are proud of our diversity and see it as a genuine source of strength for building high performing teams
 
 Key responsibilities.
 Your main responsibility is to develop, test, and deploy data science solutions together with the team. These can vary from dashboards to machine learning models.
 
 As a Senior Data Scientist in the team, you are expected to also pitch in on Product, Data Engineering and Software Engineering tasks. We have a team culture where everyone contributes when they can which leads to more “full-stack” roles.
 
 Do you think our current implementation of something is not as it should be? Take ownership and make a pull request to fix it! :)
 
 Adding new features, and making changes to our data pipeline (spark, python, deployed on Kubernetes) that joins billions of sensor readings with weather and operational data.
 
 Working with the Software Engineers on ensuring the models provide real world value, whether this will be through a simple endpoint in our API, or as part of an optimization algorithm which could be anything from a simple binary search to dynamic programming.
 
 Collaborate with the Product Owners on new opportunities for improving our applications to get happier users and a greener fleet.
 
 We are looking for.
 A self-motivated person who likes working in an agile manner and have excellent communication and teamwork skills. You must enjoy learning, sharing, and taking part in our weekly team training sessions where we read books and take courses together.
 
 You enjoy tackling unfamiliar problems and engaging with coworkers from around the organization as well as diving into new technical challenges. Our working language is English, and you should be fluent.
  Substantial experience in a similar position, working with data science solutions, ideally in a product setting, where you have learned to balance speed and quality in the development process.
 
 Great understanding of machine learning and statistics is required.
  Experience of working with agile software engineering practices such asDevOps, DataOps or MLOps.
 
 Strong skillset in SQL and python. Most of our code base is built in python, with PySpark doing some of the heavy lifting in the data pipeline.
 
 Ability to communicate findings to both peers and business stakeholders.
 
 Background in statistics, mathematics, computer science, engineering or similar.

For at lykkes, er det således vigtigt, at man som person finder energi i både at arbejde selvstændigt og i teams.

 De primære opgaver

 Bidrage til etablering og løbende optimering af nyt fokusområde indenfor data science – herunder framework, værktøjer, dokumentation, mv.
 Udvikling, implementering og vedligehold af analyser og Machine Learning modeller med afsæt i Python.

 Sparring med forretning på tværs af funktioner
 Support (2-3. level), samt bindeled til ekstern partner

 God matematisk-statistisk forståelse
 God værktøjsforståelse – gerne erfaring med Python

 Gode samarbejdsevner i en dagligdag der typisk vil variere mellem teknisk fordybelse og involvering i projekter

Vi er virkelig gode til modellering og statistik, og vi har brug for en, der vil være med på holdet til vores state of the art løsninger. Hen over efteråret idriftsætter vi flere strategisk vigtige modeller inden for anti-hvidvask og marketing. Vi vil være ét BI & Data Science team, der ejer hele dataproduktet – fra kilde til indsigt. Vi har et unikt datasæt, både i omfang og kvalitet, og vi brænder for at bruge det aktivt til ansvarlige og fornuftige løsninger. 
Dig og dine opgaver
 Vi leverer på tværs af afdelinger i Danske Spil, så du kommer rundt i organisationen. Du vil i dit daglige arbejde som Data Scientist have fokus på at skabe modeller, der giver værdi for forretningen. 
Vores arbejde er meget projektorienteret med en stor grad af frihed, hvor løbende vedligehold i teamet er forventelig i mindre grad. Dine opgaver vil blandt andet være: 

Udvikle og sparre om modeller, der kan bruges aktivt i forretningen
Kommunikere modellers performance og bagvedliggende metode bredt i organisationen
Arbejde iterativt og agilt med et ”Fail fast”-mindset

Vi forestiller os, at du har et par års erfaring eller er nyuddannet indenfor data science. Vi forventer, at du har erfaring med at kode i Python. Din rolle vil være som udførende Data Scientist, hvor du vil have berøringsflader med alle opgavetyper i data science. Det er derfor vigtigt at du: 

Vil alle aspekter af data science – både det forretningsorienterede og det tekniske
Trives med at drive projekter fremad og fjerne forhindringer som de opstår
Er god til at arbejde struktureret og have øje på bolden

Derudover er det en fordel, hvis du synes sport og spil er sjovt, da det ligger dybt i Danske Spils DNA. 
Vi gider dig! Gider du os? 
Vi er to teams, der netop er blevet slået sammen. På din første dag, vil du møde os som Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Business Partners, Product Owners, Tech Lead og Team Lead. Selvom vi har smarte titler, er vi ret jordnære og bruger en del tid på at diskutere det korrekte frokosttidspunkt. Vi er et socialt team med både introverte og ekstroverte profiler, og dog et godt sammenhold; vi har lige vundet vores interne fodboldturnering, går gerne sent hjem fra sommerfest og spiser gerne kage et par gange om ugen – typisk foranlediget af et væddemål initieret af en eller anden faglig diskussion. Vi er en blandet flok data-, brætspils-, sports- og serienørder, hvor de fleste af os prioriterer familie og os selv ret højt. 
Skriv eller ansøg direkte, hvis du vil give os lidt mere end nogle minutter af din tid. 
Du starter ansøgningsprocessen ved at klikke på ”Søg jobbet her”. Send din ansøgning, så vi har den senest den 31. august. Vi holder samtaler løbende, så send gerne din ansøgning afsted hurtigst muligt. Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Trine Brandt på tbra@danskespil.dk.

Data Specialist,Wilke Markedsanalyse A/S,8000 Aarhus,"
Vil du arbejde for en af Danmarks førende konsulent- og analysevirksomheder, hvor vi hver dag løser spændende opgaver for en bred vifte af virksomheder i såvel Danmark som udlandet? Er du typen, der elsker at arbejde med data og brænder for at skabe digitale løsninger til at forbedre forretningsprocesser – så kan du meget vel passe perfekt ind hos os i Wilke. 
Vi søger en data specialist til vores Digital Solutions afdeling i Aarhus, Odense eller København, som har flair for data management, analyse og projektledelse, og som kan bidrage til at udvikle og vedligeholde Wilkes digitale løsninger i fremtiden. 
Du vil bidrage til at definere og udvikle vores løsninger helt fra idé til færdigt produkt, og du vil også få ansvar for selve udviklingen af de konkrete løsninger, samt implementere og styre en række af vores udviklingsprojekter, fx inden for machine learning, systemarkitektur, databaseoptimering eller nye analysemetoder. Her vil du få mulighed for at arbejde tæt sammen med en række af Danmarks dygtigste virksomheder på digitale projekter hvor innovation og data er centrale dele af løsningen. 
Din rolle i Digital Solutions 
Vi er et mindre, sammentømret team i en større organisation, og du vil derfor få mulighed for mange berøringsflader og for at sætte et stort præg på vores projekter. Samtidig er et af vores mantraer, at man arbejder bedst, der hvor man har det sjovest, og derfor går vi meget op i at fordele opgaver efter interesser. For dig kunne det måske være systemarkitektur og API integrationer, machine-learning projekter til churn prediction, automatisering af datapipelines eller opsætning af dashboards på større dataindsamlinger. 
I det daglige vil din rolle være som ansvarlig frontperson på flere af vores større projekter. Vores projekter er ofte videnstunge med mange interessenter, hvor innovation og god projektledelse skal gå op i en højere enhed, for at lykkes med projektet. 
Hvem er du? 
Der er mange veje til stillingen som data specialist, da vi lægger stor vægt på dine personlige kompetencer, og derfor er vi åbne over for mange forskellige baggrunde. Det er dog centralt, at du har digitalt flair og har gode kompetencer inden for IT og data. Det kan fx være, at du arbejder som data scientist, BI-konsulent eller lignende. 
På det personlige plan elsker du struktur, og er typen der gør en dyd ud af at være detaljeorienteret. Du bliver motiveret af at sætte ting i system, og samtidig at finde system i de ting, der ikke umiddelbart er som de skal være. Du har god erfaring med projektledelse og forstår at planlægning og opfølgning er centrale elementer i at nå sine mål. 
Stillingen som data specialist er en senior stilling, og vi forventer derfor at du har flere års erhvervserfaring, som du kan bringe i spil til stillingen. 
Erfaring med nedenstående vil give dig et godt afsæt for stillingen: 

SQL 
Systemarkitektur 
API integrationer til BI systemer, telesystemer og CRM systemer 
Indgående kendskab til dashboards i PowerBI eller Tableau 
Dataanalyse, herunder gode statistikkundskaber 
Erfaring med programmeringssprog, fx C#, Python, R m.fl. 

Hvem er vi? 
Wilke er en dansk rådgivnings- og analysevirksomhed, der hjælper virksomheder og organisationer med at skabe vækst gennem værdifulde indsigter. Vi har gennem de seneste år arbejdet for nogle af Danmarks største virksomheder og fokuserer på at skabe brugbare svar, løsninger og muligheder for vores kunder, frem for rapporter der samler støv. 
Ved Wilke bliver du en del af et bredt fagligt miljø, hvor der bliver sat en ære i at lave fede ting. Vi vægter højt til loftet og en afslappet tone, hvor alles dør altid står åben (vi har faktisk nærmest ingen døre). Godt humør, plads til personlighed og ansvar er centrale i vores kultur, og vi går op i at komme hinanden ved. 
Interesseret? 
Har du lyst til at blive en del af holdet, så send din ansøgning og CV via stillingsopslaget på job.wilke.dk . Har du spørgsmål, er du velkommen til at kontakte Martin Jacobsen, mja@wilke.dk eller 61 68 87 48. 
Vi holder samtaler løbende, og besætter stillingen hurtigst muligt, så vent ikke med at sende din ansøgning. 
Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!

Vi bidrager til at optimere forretningsgange og ved at øge kvaliteten og ressourcebevidstheden i opgaveløsningen på tværs af staten. Det gør vi bl.a. gennem intelligent automatisering af sagsbehandlingen. Vi fokuserer på praktisk anvendelse af machine learning og hjælper vores kolleger i staten med design, tilpasning og implementering af de løsninger, vi udvikler til dem. Vi udvikler løsninger, som løser aktuelle forretningsudfordringer, og du skal derfor være nysgerrig på at komme tæt på forretningen hos vores samarbejdspartnere.

Det er derfor vigtigt, at du trives i at omgås og arbejde med folk med andre baggrunde end din egen, og at du både er åben over for deres input og samtidig ikke er bange for at komme med dine egne. 
 
 Om dig Vi leder efter både specialiserede data scientists og generalister, fx samfundsvidenskabelige kandidater, der har ønsket og evnen til at udvikle sig til samme. Det er ikke din baggrund, men dine konkrete, demonstrerede evner og interesser, der tæller – fx ved at du kan nikke genkendende til nogle af de nedenstående punkter og har interesse i at udvikle dig inden for dem:

Vi er et kontor med et stærkt fællesskab og mange sociale aktiviteter, hvor alle nyansatte uanset anciennitet fx får en personlig buddy og et fokuseret oplæringsforløb fra dag ét. Vi vægter feedback og personlig udvikling højt og sikrer, at det bliver prioriteret gennem løbende og årlige udviklingssnakke med ledere og kollegaer. 
 
 Hos os betyder tilstedeværelse sammen med vores kollegaer meget, og vi mener, at samarbejde og videndeling på tværs af styrelsen er afgørende for et godt arbejdsmiljø. Samtidig vil vi gerne sikre fleksibilitet for vores medarbejdere, og hjemmearbejde kan løbende aftales mellem chef og medarbejder, når det er foreneligt med opgavevaretagelsen.

SØGES: DATA SCIENTIST. HAVES: MEGAMEGET DATA OG SUPERSØDE (O...,Curia Management,Danmark,"
Hos STEP tror de på, at data er altafgørende for at flytte forretninger og skabe intelligente kommunikationsløsninger. Og de har rigtig meget data. Mere præcist får de data fra 80% af den danske befolkning. Det er altså ikke data, de mangler. Men de mangler dig, der vil være med til at indsamle, analysere, segmentere og standardisere data. Dig, der elsker data så meget, at det selvfølgelig skal indgå i din titel.

Med titlen følger et job
… og med jobbet følger nogle ret så spændende og vigtige opgaver: Det er nemlig din opgave at sikre det rette datagrundlag og understøtte STEPs dataprojekter. Selvfølgelig i tæt samarbejde med resten af teamet. Et team, der består af 15 specialister, der arbejder med dataintegration, data warehousing, udvikling af machine learning-algoritmer, business intelligence, audience data, e-mail automation og datadrevne løsninger. Fælles for hele teamet er, at de arbejder med tekniske løsninger, der giver STEP og kunderne en konkurrencemæssig fordel i markedet.
Dit ansvarsområde bliver inden for data cloud-området, hvor du bl.a. skal indsamle og behandle store mængder data fra forskellige kilder, der skal omsættes til forretningsudvikling i og uden for STEPs kommunikationskollektiv.

Mere konkret kommer dine opgaver til at være: 

Udvikling og vedligeholdelse af cloud data warehouse i Google BigQuery
Udvikling af standardisering af data på tværs af kilder
Opsætning af API-integrationer til datakilder og platforme
Dybdegående og eksplorative analyser
Identificering af brugeradfærd og brugsmønstre
Segmentering af kunde- og brugerdata
Opsætning og vedligeholdelse af automatiserede datajobs


Hvem er du
Du har en relevant videregående uddannelse. Måske har du en kandidat i matematik. Måske er du uddannet datalog eller datamatiker med nogle års erhvervserfaring. Måske har du dine kvalifikationer fra noget, vi ikke lige har tænkt over. Det vigtigste er, at du har erfaring med at behandle og analysere store datamængder.
Altså: Du har en analytisk og struktureret tilgang til komplekse problematikker. Og du trives med opgaver, der kræver stor fordybelse og koncentration. Samtidig tager du initiativ – og du er selvkørende, men allervigtigst: en teamplayer. Og så er du nysgerrig af natur – både på ny teknologi, mennesker og metoder.

På dit CV står der fx: 

Jeg har arbejdet med dataintegration og opbygning af Data Warehouse
Jeg har erfaring med cloud-baserede databaser. (Google BigQuery vil det være et +)
Jeg kender Python og SQL.
Jeg har erfaring med webprogrammering, webservice API’er og JavaScript
Jeg har kendskab til/interesse for Machine Learning og AI


Hvad vi tilbyder dig
STEP tilbyder dig ikke bare et job. De tilbyder dig udfordring og udvikling. At blive en del af et fællesskab, hvor de er meget ambitiøse (for nu at sige det, som det er). STEP kalder det et kollektiv. Og her er der altid plads til at snakke om, hvad du har lavet i weekenden – ligesom de gerne inviterer på en fredagsdrink, på tværs af afdelinger. 
Praktisk stuff
Du kommer til at sidde på STEPs hovedkontor i Nedergade i Odense – tæt på kaffebarer og fredagsbarer. Stillingen er på 37 timer.

Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Computational Modeling...,Hvidovre Hospital,2650 Hvidovre,"
 The Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance (DRCMR) has an open research opportunity for a highly motivated postdoctoral scientist to conduct cutting-edge research at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuroscience, and magnetic resonance imaging.
 



 Join us as we start on a project testing the predictions of a novel theory of dopamine signaling in the human brain and its implications for Parkinson’s disease.
 



 We are looking for a candidate with strong computational modeling skills in the context of MRI of the human brain. The position is part of a project with the aim to map the dopaminergic system with functional MRI and to measure how it changes in patients with Parkinson’s disease. You will mainly be involved in the data acquisition and data analysis part of the project, further developing and applying a computational technique for topographic mapping in fMRI data. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with psychologists, MDs, physiologists, basic and clinical neuroscientists.
 




About us: 


The Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance (DRCMR) is one of the leading research centers for biomedical MRI in Europe (www.drcmr.dk). Our mission is to triangulate MR physics, basic physiology, and clinical research. Approximately 70 researchers from a diverse range of disciplines are currently pursuing basic and clinically applied MR, electrophysiology, and brain stimulation research with a focus on structural, functional, and metabolic MRI of the human brain and its disorders. 
 

MRI is the scientific focus area of the DRCMR . We are currently developing a novel analysis approach to generate topographic maps of cognitive computational variables with fMRI data in order to gain much richer insights into human cognition than commonly used fMRI analysis approaches. We aim to use this technique to gain novel insights into the effects of neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic system on brain function, cognition and behavior in Parkinson´s disease.
 



 The DRCMR is part of the Center for Functional and Diagnostic Imaging and Research 
 , a large diagnostic imaging department that covers all biomedical imaging modalities at 
 Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre .
 




The position: 

 You will be employed as a postdoc for a 
 two-year period at the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance with good possibilities of extension. You will join the Movement Disorders group led by Research Fellow David Meder. The project entails close collaborations with other researchers in the Clinical Precision Imaging research area and the Cognitive & Computational Neuroscience research area.
 



 As a postdoc you will have close interaction with DRCMR-researchers from a great variety of disciplines and with collaborators as well as clinicians. We act in concert, and you are never alone with your tasks. 
 
 Your daily tasks will vary according to the flow of the projects, but will mainly be centered around:
 



conducting MRI experiments with healthy participants and patients with Parkinson’s disease 
analyzing MRI and behavioral data, including the application of our topographic mapping technique 
engaging in teaching, knowledge dissemination, and publication of results in international, recognized scientific journals 



The ideal candidate 



You hold a PhD degree in Neuroscience or a related field. 
You are an expert in computational modeling and/or fMRI data analysis. 
You enjoy being part of a multidisciplinary and international research team and integrating technological innovations into your neuroscience research. 
You have experience in conducting experiments with human subjects—preferably including patients. 
Additional expertise in Bayesian modeling or Bayesian statistics is a major advantage. 
You have excellent written and interpersonal communication skills. 


 The project will be supervised by Research Fellow David Meder in close collaboration with Prof. Hartwig Siebner and senior researcher Oliver Hulme.
 




Starting date: is expected to be October 2022.
 




Salary and Terms of Employment 

 You will be employed as a postdoc for a period of 24 months with good possibilities of extension. Salary, pension and terms of employment are in accordance with the agreement between the Danish Regions (Danske Regioner) and the relevant professional organization. The salary depends on background education and seniority. Further, supplements can be negotiated. Note that candidates coming from abroad may be eligible for tax reductions. The position is open for candidates of all nationalities.
 



 We see diversity as strength and encourage all persons regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, disabilities or religion to apply.
 




Applications should include a cover letter, references, list of publications and CV (optionally narrative CV, see e.g. https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/). Applications must be submitted on-line through the

 Who you are (minimum qualifications)


 3+ years working on technology-powered products as a product manager, product designer, engineer, data scientist, user researcher, Scrum master or a similar role.
 Demonstrated understanding of the techniques and methods of modern product discovery and product delivery.
 Demonstrated ability to learn multiple functional areas of business – engineering, design, finance, sales, or marketing.
 Demonstrated ability to figure out solutions to hard problems with many constraints, using sound judgment to assess risks, and lay out your argument in a well-structured, data-informed, written narrative.
 Proven ability to engage with engineers, designers, and company leaders in a constructive and collaborative relationship.


 About the work


 We empower our product teams to solve hard problems – customer problems and business problems – in ways that our customers love, yet work for our business. We work in cross-functional squads, generally comprised of a product manager, a product designer, and several engineers.
    
 Our squads have the skills necessary to come up with effective solutions that are valuable, viable, usable and feasible. The designer ensures the solution is usable, the engineers ensure the solution is feasible, and the product manager is accountable for ensuring the solution is both valuable and viable.
    
 Product managers contribute to their squads a deep knowledge of our users and customers, and data about how our customers engage with our products. Product managers must also contribute a solid knowledge of the various constraints of the business – constraints from marketing, sales, service, finance, legal, and privacy for example. Finally, the product manager is expected to track industry trends and the competitive landscape as they pertain to their product.
    
 We look for product managers that understand that consistent innovation is the result of each member of the product team contributing their passion and their ideas. The product manager collaborates closely with their product designer and engineers to discover effective solutions, and then work together to deliver those solutions to market.
    
 We empower our squads to figure out the best solutions to the problems that need to be solved and we hold them accountable to the results. Shipping is necessary, but not sufficient. We look for product managers that aren’t afraid to sign up for results, even when this means they have to work through others to achieve the necessary results. We look for people who want to develop themselves and grow their career.
    
 This job is an individual contributor role; you’ll need to be able to influence your teammates, colleagues, stakeholders, and key executives through your use of data and logic.

Sport subscription

REANNOUNCEMENT - Postdoc in Spatial Transcriptomics,Syddansk Universitet,Odense,"
We are looking for a highly motivated researcher for a two-year position, who will work with state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomics, transcriptomics, and bioimaging to comprehensively characterize cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions in healthy and diseased human tissues. The position is to commence 1 November 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter. Application deadline: 16 October 2022.  The selected candidate will be working in the group of Associate Professor Kim Ravnskjær, but will also be part of an interdisciplinary team involving four research groups at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) and the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) under the common direction of Associate Professor Jonathan Brewer, SDU.  The selected candidate will be integrated into the Center for Functional Genomics and Tissue Plasticity (ATLAS) in close affiliation with the Danish Molecular Biomedical Imaging Center at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  The revolution in single-cell transcriptomics have shown the need for spatially resolved technologies to visualize cellular diversity and interactions in the context of intact tissues. This has led to the recent development of new technologies to acquire full transcriptome wide data at single cell level and with high spatial resolution. These new technologies are likely to transform our understanding of biological processes and human diseases and form the basis for development of new treatments.  We are focused on state-of-the-art imaging-based technologies for spatial transcriptomics. We have implemented MERFISH technology to elucidate tissue microenvironments in both patient and animal biopsies and in complex disease models using engineered tissues. Specifically, we are developing three MERFISH platforms for spatial transcriptomics at different scales to visualize the transcriptome from whole tissue slices, down to transcript distribution and co-localization at the sub-organellar scale.  Job description  The research focus for this position is to integrate these techniques with conventional transcriptomics and bioimaging, to characterize cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions in healthy and diseased human tissues including skin biopsies, 3D bioprinted human skin models, and liver biopsies.  A main goal of the work, regarding the study of human skin, will be to understand the molecular bases for its mechanical properties. We will therefore thoroughly characterize the effect of mechanical stimuli on the tissue by performing single-cell transcriptomics and MERFISH on unstimulated and mechanically challenged skin. We expect to identify hundreds of novel regulators of skin mechanical properties, which we will use to improve the properties of bioprinted human skin models.  Regarding the human liver, we wish to resolve hepatic tissue plasticity and infer cellular interactions from liver biopsies. Cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions are instrumental to disease progression. Comprehensive cell interaction trajectories will hence be inferred from single-cell transcriptomics and MERFISH data and linked to disease stage and detailed patient characterization to gain novel insight into the cellular and structural basis for disease.  You will be working in a dynamic international team focused on spatial transcriptomics and bioimaging. In your daily work, you will report to Associate Professor Kim Ravnskjær, but will also be associated with the group of Associate Professor Jonathan Brewer.  Your qualifications We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic scientist.  Essential experience and skills:

A PhD in molecular biology, biophysics, nanotechnology, physics, biochemistry, or a similar field.
Experience with transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and/or spatial transcriptomics such as MERFISH.
Experience with analysis of transcriptomics data.
Proficient communication skills and the ability and desire to work as part of a team.
Excellent English skills, both written and spoken.

Desirable experience and skills:

Experience with bioimaging and preparation of biological samples for microscopy.
Molecular biology skills such as qPCR and in vitro transcription for MERFISH probe design.
Experience with single molecule localization microscopy (STORM).
