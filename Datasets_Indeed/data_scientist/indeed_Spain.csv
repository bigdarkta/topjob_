In the past you have faced data-atheists and does not frustrate you to lead them in the path of data conversion. 


You know how to create metrics that measure the performance of certain customer behaviours and enjoy the experimentation of behavioural actions to analyze the evolution of the created indicators.

You have worked on several projects at the same time and understand how to balance delivery and progress. 
You enjoy never-faced challenges and data sources, and know how to prioritize opportunities with business needs and Directors’ requests; however our Senior Data Team is composed of ex-members of the most prestigious data-companies and academic programs, and we know that success comes only through collaboration. 
Your critical scientific thinking is normally reinforced by listening to others’ opinions with respect to the best algorithmic decisions; however you easily recognize where a logistic-regression will do the job to achieve an 80% acceptable solution. 
Scalable solutions and production-readiness are two of your mantras; however, we have a ML-Operations team that will support you in achieving technical excellence. 
You are not afraid of designing an ETL for a newly introduced dataset, generating concrete specifications for its automation; despite we have a robust Data Engineering team maintaining hundreds of Scala ETLs, the seniority of this role requires being able to communicate with this highly technical team. 
Supervising other fellow data scientists is an attractive point as it can eventually help you achieve bigger more interesting initiatives. In our team, we nurture a meritocratic culture trying to provide professional development opportunities.

Dealing with large datasets, and implementing scalable solutions. You know when pandas breaks and have dealt with different distributed solutions such as dask or spark. 
How to solve problems using data: analyze the problem and decompose it into different analytical components, and recycle all the components you can from other projects. 
Software development: you know what git means, and how to develop your own code, test it and use it to produce actionable results. Open-source lovers get a plus if you show us your github! 
Data Visualization, and tools like ggplot, matplotlib, tableau, or similar. Bonus points for plotly, and standing ovation for Quicksight. 
For this level of seniority, you have experience on geo-spatial analytics, graph-theory, and natural-language processing. 
Automation Obsessed: Cloud infrastructures are your main asset in order to automate all ML-related problem so the machine does the most of the work for you, or at least you are highly interested in collaborating closely with the ML-Ops team. 


What do we offer? 

Immediate incorporation to a dynamic and agile company with a growth and expansion project. 
Working in start-up mode with the support of Grupo Santander. 
Competitive remuneration and attractive benefits package.

What are we looking for?
About you
We are looking for a talented Analyst Data Scientist to join the Analysis & Monitoring team. Our ideal candidate should be enthusiastic about quality assessment of models, trading algorithms and quantitative strategies, as well as building strong relationships with our business stakeholders to provide them with the best support on their functional questions. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to oversight all the productive models, algos and strategies from Advanced Analytics & Algorithmic Trading.
Your experience
The ideal candidate will have:

 A master degree in physics, mathematics, statistics, engineering or computer science.
 Outstanding mathematical literacy: you should be able to discuss business problems using mathematical terms on a piece of paper.
 Programming skills in languages like Python or Scala.
 Practical knowledge of standard statistics and machine learning libraries, and big data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark
 Good English level. 
Spanish is valuable but optional: we welcome international applications.
 The team is fully integrated into business units. You will have the opportunity to generate high impact with your work, but a strong commitment to delivery is a must have.

About the area
Advanced Analytics & Algorithmic Trading is the team of Data Scientists in C&IB Global Markets that implement trading algorithms, quantitative investment strategies and advanced analytics models for trading and sales teams. We have a strong focus on analyzing and monitoring the quality of all our implementations and providing first class support to our business stakeholders. That is the reason why we have a specialized team, Analysis & Monitoring, that handles these critical tasks.
About the job

Key Responsabilities:

 Design, implementation and monitoring of quality controls for advanced analytics models, trading algorithms and quantitative investment strategies. These controls ensure that the performance of models and algos does not deteriorate after their release to production.
 Data analysis of the behavior of productive models, algos and strategies. These implementations generate a large amount of data that requires Data Science tools to understand it and explain it to the business. Rigorous evaluation of financial impact and KPIs of productive models, algos and strategies. For instance, by analyzing A/B testing results.
 Challenge Data Scientists from the product teams before releasing models or algos into production, by doing a peer review of their proposal.
 Engage with the Advanced Analytics Discipline in implementing best practices regarding model monitoring. Provide functional support to the business units (traders and sales) regarding data analytics, models, trading algorithms or quantitative strategies.

 To give you an idea, a few examples of topics you would be looking at are:

 From Concept Drift to Model Degradation: An Overview on Performance-Aware Drift Detectors, by F. Bayram, B.S. Ahmed, and A. Kassler: arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11070.pdf .
 Machine Learning in Non-Stationary Environments: Introduction to Covariate Shift Adaptation, by Sugiyama M. and Kawanabe M.
 Advances in Financial Machine Learning, by Marcos López de Prado.
 The Science of Algorithmic Trading and Portfolio Management, by Kissell, R.

 How can you expect that a typical day unfolds if you join the team?

 You will start the day checking that our trading algorithms, models and quantitative strategies, as well as the supporting analytics processes, have a smooth start.
 Later, you will join the rest of the data scientists to discuss their different lines of work and share ideas.
 Sitting on the open trading floor, or working from home (we operate in a flexible 60% office, 40% home scheme), you will have extensive time to engage with our business stakeholders on functional questions; discuss with product data scientists potential quality issues in their implementations; improve and implement new data science based monitoring processes that evaluate the potential degradation of algos, models and strategies; analyze financial impact and KPIs; participate in workflows of approval of new implementations by challenging the product data scientists proposals from a functional point of view; and investigate potential alerts regarding the performance of algos, models and strategies.
 Some time might be also allocated for learning and training, either at campus BBVA or with the rest of the team in our journal and book club sessions, where we discuss in group the latest books and papers relevant to our activity.

Product Data Scientist,Graphext Labs,Teletrabajo temporalmente,"



Pasively Hiring

 We are looking for a Product Data Scientist. Remote. 


What do we do at Graphext?
 We are a team of 21 people who develop software for people with a business, economics, biology, engineering or journalism background to enable them to do advanced data analytics without knowing how to write code. Our tool is designed for creative people who find existing products like Excel, Tableau or Power BI too limited .
 We allow them to perform analyses that are more ""predictive"" and ""prescriptive"" than descriptive. Graphext projects are built to give people with the same power of analysis as if they had studied Maths or Computer Science and know how to write code in Python or R. Currently, Graphext has over 50 different use cases that we have identified so far, from developing new drugs to understanding why some crimes are growing or why the employees of a company are leaving.
 Current data science methods demand learning to code in Python or R, something that can take years. They don't guide you either and don't help you discover what methods and techniques are appropriate for different kinds of analysis - data cleaning, enrichment, modelling - in order to solve many business problems. These tools aren't very interactive and, often, you can only work with structured data. They miss all the possibilities we now have to analyze texts and images thanks to AI's latest advancements.
 What does the product look like?
 Go and check in our web to see how the product works.
 Our Youtube channel, presents more detailed videos introducing you to the product and taking you through some use cases.
 We also regularly post projects we do ourselves, with clients and collaborators on our Twitter and Blog.
 How is this company doing?
 Graphext started at the beginning of 2014. The two co-founders, Victoriano and Miguel, spent the first years building another product, Contexto, that inspired them to raise money from venture capital (Kfund is our main investor) to build Graphext (2017). To this date, the company has received over 3M euros in funding.
 At the same time, we also keep growing our revenue as we sign more and more customers every month.
 Who are we looking for?
 You will work in our data science team. Our data science team is divided into two: data science engineers and product data scientists. While our data science engineers are focused on writing code to apply machine learning algorithms for the internal workings of the product, product data scientists focus on understanding business problems and design solutions with our available features at Graphext as well as helping the data science engineers develop new features.
 This position requires a curiosity about real-world problems, good communication skills and an ability to fully interrogate problems. On top of this, you should have a solid understanding of the whole toolbox available to solve data problems.
 At the same time, we also expect our product data scientist to act as our own data scientists to find insights about our own users with all the information we collect about our product usage. We released a freemium version of the product last summer and we already have information about thousands of data analysts which is crucial to interpret to make strategic decisions on sales, marketing, and product.
 What we are expecting from you
 Data Skills

 You have a degree or some form of education related to data science (CS, Math, Physics, Engineering degree...)
 You are pretty familiar with Python and/or R libraries to do data cleaning and data exploration like Pandas or Tidyverse.
 You have some experience with SQL and APIs.
 You have developed data models of some form: regressions, decision tree, xgboost, ARIMA

 Communications and soft skills

 You speak good English.
 Verbal and writing communication skills. Being able to summarize the calls and email you have with a customer is essential for the follow-ups of your teammates.
 Curiosity and interest for data science, data analytics and business problems.
 Being a chatty person who normally has more questions than answers.
 Energetic, self-motivated, goal achiever, ambitious .
 Empathetic, storyteller.
 Fast learner, flexible, risk taker.
 Committed, organized, proactive.

 Extra points if you...

 Have previous experience with NLP or Computer Vision.
 Have previous experience working with Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI, Metabase...
 Speak Spanish as well as English.
 Have previous experience in start-up environments.

 ‍
 What is it like to work at Graphext?
 About your teammates
 Leading the data science team is Thomas, who joined Graphext almost 4 years ago. He has a PHD in AI and Adaptive Systems. Beyond his academic experience he also worked for another startup in the UK for 4 years developing physical simulations for adaptive experiences in video games. He is German, but speaks Spanish perfectly. On his side we have Jorge who joined Graphext while he was still a student of Maths and CS, after 3.5 years, he has become a senior data scientist engineer crucial for the core development of our platform.
 Mariadel is the other product data scientist of the team, you will work very close to her. She came to Graphext in 2020, weeks before the first lock down. She studied Maths and CS in Granada and did a Master degree at AFI, where she now teaches classes on data science. 
Since we are still a relatively small startup - 21 people in total - you will also be very close with the rest of engineers, product manager, marketing and sales. Check out our team page. 
Compensation plan

 We offer a competitive salary.
 You will choose the machine which you would like to work on. Most of us are using Macbook Pro or MacBook Air. You will decide if you prefer Windows rather than MacOs

 Where and when

 This is a remote position. Since the COVID-19 started even though we have an office in central Madrid, the entire team is now working remotely.
 We are really flexible about how you administer your time.
 Really flexible about your vacations too. Just coordination with the rest of the team is required. We offer 23 days of holidays per year + your local holidays.

 Our core values

 Our culture is based on responsibility. We are still a small company and we don't want to have more managers and individual contributors. We focus on hiring people we can trust without supervision and with a strong motivation to keep growing as a professional.
 We like honesty and transparency. We believe most big issues arise as a result of small misunderstandings and a lack of communication.
 We do our best to create an environment where people can speak freely as well as being authentic and empathetic with other team members.
 We try to to have as few meetings as possible.
 Even though we are a startup, we play a long game, and take care to avoid burnout. If you want or need to work many hours one day because you had flow, you were inspired or there was an emergency, you will work less the following day. You are not going to be sprinting for weeks.
 We have a global mindset. Even though most of the team members are Spanish we are open to hiring anybody from anywhere. We make sure peoplcomfortablertable communicating in English. Everything is documented and reported in English.

Data Content Creator,Graphext Labs,Teletrabajo temporalmente,"



Pasively Hiring

 Data content creator & community builder. Remote or Madrid.


 What do we do at Graphext?
 We are a team of 18 people. We develop software for people who studied business, economics, biology, psycology, engineering, journalism... to enable them to do advanced data analytics without knowing how to write code. For those creative people that find Excel and current business intelligence tools (like Tableau or Power BI) too limited.
 We allow them to run analyses that are more ""predictive"" and ""prescriptive"" than descriptive, with the same power of analysis as if they had studied Maths or Computer Science and knew how to write code in Python or R... for more than 50 different use cases that we have identified so far... from developing new drugs, to understand why some crimes are growing o why the employees of a company are leaving.
 Current data science tools demand learning to code in Python or R (which takes years until someone is fluid enough). These tools don't guide you either. Don't help you discover what methods and techniques are appropriate for different kinds of analysis (data cleaning, enrichment, modeling) to solve many business problems. These tools aren't very interactive (you need a quick feedback loop to understand what you are doing), and you can only work with structure data (numerical and categorical data). They miss all the possibilities we now have to analyze texts and images thanks to AI's latest advancements.
 What does the product look like?
 Go and check in our web to see how the product works.
 In our Youtube channel, you will find more detailed videos.
 We also post reguarly more examples in our Twitter and Blog.
 How is this company doing?
 Graphext actually started at the beginning of 2014. The two co-founders, Victoriano and Miguel, spent the first years building another product that inspired them to later, in 2017, raise money from venture capital ( Kfund is our main investor ) to build Graphext. Up to this date, the company has received over 3M euros in funding.
 At the same time, we also keep growing our revenue as we sign more and more customers every month.
 What is this role all about?
 We believe that the best marketing is a great product that is so good, that people need to tell everyone about it when they try it for the first time: word of mouth.
 In 3.5 years, we haven’t hired a single person for a marketing role because we wanted to focus on making the product great. We recently launched a freemium version of Graphext so anyone can register and try the product on their own. We are starting to feel comfortable to reach way more people from those that organically met us (around 100 people a day visit organically our website) by word of mouth and reading our content primerarly in Spanish for now. This also made 80% of the people visiting our website come from Spain (where we are originally from). It's time to make the world knows about what we are doing (in English).
 We also believe the second-best way of doing marketing is education. Buyers now prefer to self-educate. 3 of 4 business software buyers would rather self-educate than learn about a product from an sales person. Our potential customers are curious and creative minds. They love learning about new things. So that's why we want to bet on high-quality content in multiple forms:

 This diagram represents the multiple platforms where we are currently posting content to drive traffic to sign up for Graphext, try the product, and eventually pay for a pro account if they are happy with the solution.
 These are some of the principles we want to follow:

 Quality over Quantity. The internet is already full of content. We compete for attention with pages like Towardsdatascience but especially against Youtubers, Netflix, and even WhatsApp memes, if the content is bad, nobody will read it, our brand will be irrelevant.
 Be succinct. Every single word counts. We can totally write long pieces (like this job offer) but every paragraph has to say something relevant. Twitter threads are a good way to encapsulate as much meaning as possible.
 Images and Videos over text. The ratio images vs text should be high (not like this job offer)
 Use the language and style of every platform. The same way you speak differently to your parents than to your friends, Twitter and LinkedIn have different audiences, their language and technicality should change.

 This Pricenomics content marketing handbook is gold.
 We don't expect you to create all this content alone. You will create content, but a big part of your mission is to encourage our team to participate in creating this content, and you will find external collaborators: users that already use the product, customers, influencers, journalists... and you can also count on the design team to help you elaborating this content.
 We really admire the way Notion, Figma, or Webflow are building communities of enthusiastic users around their products. We would like to become the data analytics tool in this new generation of SaaS tools.
 What we are expecting from you
 Data Science Skills
 Genuine Curiosity for data analytics - We expect you to be very motivated about the possibilities data is bringing to the world, even if you have all the other skills we are listing below, if you are not passionate about this, we won't succeed.
 Data Science Knowledge - You will need to understand a lot of concepts in this field. If you already have studied or learned on your own about data analytics and can even program in Python or R, that's fantastic otherwise, if you have the motivation, you learn them with us.
 Networking Skills
 Knowledge of Existing Data Media - You will be in charge of distributing our content, teach Graphext, reach out to influencers or reporters. If you already know key opinion leaders in this field and publications in this area, that's another extra point.
 Communication Skills
 English - As mentioned before one of our main objectives is to reach an international audience, we expect you to have a fluid English, if you speak Spanish even better, but for this role; English is more important.
 Creativity to generate ideas for content - Even though we have tons of ideas about what to publish, there are probably many other ideas way better we are missing. It will be also your responsibility to prioritize these ideas.
 Writing Skills - Clear writing means clear thinking.
 Audiovisual Skills - We want to bet a lot for audiovisual content (YouTube videos, streaming on Twitch, maybe podcasts..) I love these Webflow video tutorials for instance.

 Extra points if you...

 You have experience with SEO and SEM.
 You have experience with BI tools like Tableau, Power BI...
 Knowledge about no-code tools as Notion, Webflow, Airtable, Zapier, Integromat...
 You have experience using CRMs like Hubspot.
 You have a bachelor's degree or master or any other educational background that proves you are hard-working, patient, and smart enough! (You can also be all these things without one, but might save some time for us to test it)
 Previous experience in start up environments.

 What is it like to work at Graphext?
 About your teammates
 You will mainly work with Victoriano, CEO, and co-founder, who is also the person that currently does most of these tasks in Graphext. He is excited to finally hire someone to take this to the next level.
 You will also be very close to the business team, lead by Brais and Sergio, and the product data scientists (Mariadel & Marcos).
 We are now around 20 people in the team, that you will also meet and interact with, most of them developers.
 Compensation plan

 We offer a competitive salary.
 You will choose the machine which you would like to work on. Most of us are using Macbook Pro or MacBook Air. You will decide if you prefer Windows rather than MacOs

 Where and when

 This is a remote position. Since the COVID-19 started even though we have an office in central Madrid, the entire team is now working remotely.
 We are really flexible about how you administrate your time.
 Really flexible about your vacations too. Just coordination with the rest of the team is required.

 Our core values

 Our culture is based on responsibility. We are still a small company and we don't want to have more managers and individual contributors, so we focus on hiring people we expect we can trust without supervising all the time, with a high intrisinc motivation to keep growing as a professional.
 We like honesty and transparency. We believe most big issues arise as small misunderstandings and lack of communication end up erosionating trust for not having enough information to understand decissions.
 We really do our best to create an environment where people can speak freely, being authentic and empathic at the same time with all your peers.
 We try to to have as few meetings as possibles.
 Even though we are a startup, we play a long game, and we care to avoid bourn out. If you want or need to work many hours one day because you had flow, you were inspired, or there was an emergency, you will work less the following day. You are not gonna be sprinting for weeks.
 We have a global mindset. Even though most of the team members are Spanish we are open to hiring anybody from anywhere. We make sure people are confortable communicating in English. Everything is documented and reporting in English.

Ayudante Investigacion-PEJCAM: “Machine learning for correla...,IMDEA materials,"Madrid, Madrid provincia","

IMDEA Materials Institute is a public research organization founded in 2007 by Madrid’s regional government to carry out research of excellence in Material Science and Engineering by attracting talent from all over the world to work in an international and multidisciplinary environment. IMDEA Materials has grown rapidly since its foundation and currently includes more than 120 researchers from 22 nationalities and has become one of the leading research centers in materials in Europe which has received the María de Maeztu seal of excellence from the Spanish government. The research activities have been focused on the areas of materials for transport, energy, and health care and the Institute has state-of-the-art facilities for processing, characterization and simulation of advanced materials. More information can be found at https://materials.imdea.org/
 

DESCRIPTION

(English)  The presence of porosity in carbon fibre reinforced composite materials is a common manufacturing defect that could endanger the in-service performance of components. To ensure quality standards, the industry relies on ultrasonic non-destructive testing due to its cost and ease of use. However, to date, ultrasonic methods have not been able to assess porosity levels independently of other attributes such as pores morphology, size, and distribution. One possible solution is to address the problem of relating porosity with ultrasonic propagation utilizing data-driven methodologies. The use of machine learning models could discover the hidden patterns of the interaction between the porosity and the ultrasound wave. A possible solution relates features of the ultrasound wave with porosity characteristics obtained from three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed XCT volumes of carbon fiber composites via machine learning models. We tested some machine learning models that improve the prediction of pore volume fraction by using these data.
 In this project, the candidate will test and optimize new machine learning models including (but not restricted to) k-neighbours, support vector machines, ensemblings, and neural networks.
 On the other hand, X-ray tomography is by far the best technique non-destructive damage assessment in composite materials, being able to identify in 3D manufacturing defects as well as damage generated upon external forces. Thus, part of the job is to take advantage of this non-destructive technique for the determination of damage evolution (cracks, delamination, fibre fracture, etc.) in sequential and in situ testing using XCT. For this purpose, the project will use both laboratory and synchrotron X-ray tomography techniques. Machine learning techniques will be used for the identification of damage.
 The work involves material testing, ultrasonic inspection, X-ray characterization, data analysis and programming. Therefore, a high interest in programming is mandatory. Some programming knowledge (preferable in python) is desirable, as well as in machine learning techniques, data visualization, image analysis.
 (Español)
 La presencia de porosidad en los materiales compuestos reforzados con fibra de carbono es un defecto de fabricación común que podría poner en peligro el rendimiento en servicio de los componentes. Para garantizar los estándares de calidad, la industria se basa en pruebas ultrasónicas no destructivas debido a su costo y facilidad de uso. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, los métodos ultrasónicos no han podido evaluar los niveles de porosidad independientemente de otros atributos como la morfología, el tamaño y la distribución de los poros. Una posible solución es abordar el problema de relacionar la porosidad con la propagación ultrasónica utilizando metodologías basadas en datos. El uso de modelos de aprendizaje automático podría descubrir los patrones ocultos de la interacción entre la porosidad y la onda de ultrasonido. Una posible solución relaciona las características de la onda de ultrasonido con las características de porosidad obtenidas a partir de volúmenes XCT reconstruidos tridimensionales (3D) de compuestos de fibra de carbono a través de modelos de aprendizaje automático. Hemos ya probado algunos modelos de aprendizaje automático que mejoran la predicción de la fracción de volumen de poros mediante el uso de estos datos. 
En este proyecto, el candidato probará y optimizará nuevos modelos de aprendizaje automático que incluyen (pero no se limitan a) k-vecinos, máquinas de vectores de soporte, conjuntos, y redes neuronales. 
Por otro lado, la tomografía de rayos X (XCT) es, con diferencia, la mejor técnica no destructiva de evaluación de daños en materiales compuestos, pudiendo identificar en 3D defectos de fabricación como así también daños generados por fuerzas externas. En este contexto, parte del trabajo es usar las ventajas de esta técnica no destructiva para la determinación de la evolución del daño (fisuras, delaminación, fractura de fibras, etc.) en ensayos secuenciales e in situ mediante XCT. Para ello, el proyecto utilizará técnicas de tomografía de rayos X tanto de laboratorio como de sincrotrón. Se usarán técnicas de inteligencia artificial para la detección de daño.
 El trabajo involucra ensayos de materiales, inspección ultrasónica, caracterización de rayos X, análisis de datos y programación. Por lo tanto, un alto interés en la programación es obligatorio. Es deseable algún conocimiento de programación (preferiblemente en python), así como en técnicas de aprendizaje automático, visualización de datos, análisis de imágenes.

 En el último año hemos dado un gran salto al pasar de medir el rendimiento de nuestros proyectos y productos digitales a través de herramientas de analítica a crear un área de Data con proyectos y casos de uso propios de diferentes perfiles tales como Data Engineers, Data Scientist y Data Analytics. 

 En eºmergya nos hemos convertido en 3 años en el mayor referente de asistentes virtuales conversacionales basados en Google a nivel nacional. Llevamos ya un año trabajando en conseguir lo mismo con todo el área de Inteligencia Artificial, utilizando tecnología Google: recomendadores de producto inteligente, clusterización de clientes, predicción de precios y por supuesto analítica avanzada de datos.

Uso de lenguajes de programación como Python, librerías (Tensorflow, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn...) y conocimiento en algoritmos (regresión, clusterización, segmentación...). 
Aplicar técnicas y modelos de aprendizaje automático de cara a obtener soluciones concretas orientadas a mejorar el negocio de nuestros clientes. 
Trabajar con infraestructuras cloud, especialmente en el stack de Google Cloud: Pub/Sub, Data Storage, DataFlow, BigQuery, Notebooks, Vertex AI, etc… 

 En tu día a día, participarás complementando proyectos de inteligencia artificial pero, sobre todo, entrarás a formar parte de un equipo muy orientado a dar salida a las soluciones de Data Scientist de la compañía.

MLOps Engineer,BDEO,"Teletrabajo in 28029 Madrid, Madrid provincia","
Hello there!
 I am Antonio David Fernández Reyes (CTO of Bdeo). We are working on building an awesome agile team that works on creating epic products with a challenging vision: transforming the insurance industry with Visual Intelligence solutions.
 Bdeo was founded +5 years ago and it has been an amazing adventure since the beginning. Last year was just incredible. We reached +40 insurers, scaled our operations to 22 countries, raised a 5M-euro series A led by international VCs, and were able to grow revenue by a factor of 3 with the business of our loyal and new customers.
 We couldn't be happier with the results. We've grown the team to around 70 people in different countries, (we already had offices in Madrid and Mexico) and we are positioned as the referent within the Visual Intelligence industry for the insurance industry.
 This year we are focused on achieving much more. We are lucky enough to say that we are building a team of dreamers and doers, committed to making the insurance and claim processes easier for users and more efficient for companies. We are doing it by building the most advanced Visual Intelligence SaaS technology.
 Growing the team to achieve technical excellence
 If you join Bdeo, you would become a reference in a multidisciplinary agile team with a great work environment where every day we pursue excellence in order to continue revolutionizing the insurance industry with visual intelligence solutions.
 We develop features and products that make us be one of the most cutting-edge solutions on the market. Probably you are wondering what we do...
 We want to build products that allow companies to provide customers with the user experience that each of us would love to face when underwriting an insurance policy or when managing a claim after a car accident.
 How insurers manage a motor insurance claim is one of the most sensitive touch points in terms of customer loyalty. We want to help companies reduce the time between the notification of a claim and its resolution.
 Our goal is to provide a technological solution that allows companies to automate processes, be more efficient, and improve customer expectations. Pretty challenging, right?
 Do you like transforming the way companies do things? Do you believe any process can be improved in order to make it more efficient? Do you love technical challenges? Do you want to join a team in which you can have a high impact? We are looking for you!
 Join us in our mission to give companies the power to change the industry.

 A master degree in physics, mathematics, statistics, engineering or computer science. A PhD will be valuable.
 5+ years of experience in a quantitative or data science role in the financial industry or a similar business environment.
 Previous experience leading a team or managing projects will be beneficial, but we encourage applications from any ambitious candidate with a clear strategic vision to help us fulfill our mission.

 Programming skills in languages like Python, Java and/or Scala.
 Practical knowledge of standard statistics and machine learning libraries, and big data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark.
 Entrepreneurial mindset.
 Good English level. Spanish is valuable but optional: we welcome international applications.
 The ability to work under pressure. We work in a business environment and this requires from time to time to commit to tight deadlines.




Overview
 About the job

In Advanced Analytics & Algorithmic Trading at C&IB Global Markets, we have the mission to support the transformation of our business into a more scientific, data-driven business one. We have a rare opening for someone to help us develop this mission by taking a leading role as a Manager Data Scientist in charge of our portfolio of Equities projects. We are looking for someone with strong mathematical, programming and data science skills, a business oriented mindset, and an entrepreneurial spirit.
 The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work in exciting areas like:

 The implementation and backtesting of trading strategies four our nascent Quantitative Investment Strategies business
 The analysis of client behavior and segmentation to automate marketing campaigns and calculate optimal prices for digital products.
 The development of data-driven hedging methodologies for single instruments and portfolios.
 The incorporation of liquidity and market impact into the pricing of derivatives using advanced mathematical models.
 The generation of trading factors and signals using machine learning algorithms.

 To give you an idea or our portfolio of projects, a few examples of papers and books you could come across working in projects in our team are:

 Optimal Execution and Block Trade Pricing: a general framework, by Olivier Gueant.

 How can you expect that a typical day unfolds if you join the team?:

 You will start the day checking with the business that our models and quantitative strategies have a smooth start.
 Later, you will join the rest of the data scientists to discuss their different lines of work and share ideas. If you are working in a multi-team agile project, you will probably meet your scrum team.
 As a team leader sitting on the open trading floor, or working from home (we operate in a flexible 60% office, 40% home scheme), you will have extensive time to progress in your work and lead the data scientists working in Equities projects. You will also have frequent informal discussions with traders and sales as needed to ensure your work has a large impact in the business.
 During breaks at the office, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of Ciudad BBVA, with its many services and open spaces.
 Some time might be also allocated for learning and training, either at campus BBVA or with the rest of the team in our journal and book club sessions, where we discuss in group the latest books and papers relevant to our activity.

Data Scientist,Zurich Insurance,"Barcelona, Barcelona provincia","

Our opportunity




  Within the Data and Business Intelligence area, DBI Studio is responsible for building the solutions which support the Group’s decision making and efficiency. We have a truly global reach: our internal clients are Group Functions responsible for the Group’s core processes and Business Units bringing Zurich’s products and services to all geographic areas.
 



  The activity of DBI Studio’s Data Science team is instrumental to Zurich’s transformation into a data-driven organization. Working shoulder to shoulder with engineers, designers, product managers and business stakeholders, we deliver effective models and reusable products. We strive for robustness, safety and clarity. We are adaptable and make it a point to never stick to our comfort zone and constantly push the boundary of the technologies and models available to Zurich.
 



  By joining us, you will be part of a team committed to make things better day after day and to invest in each other’s growth. Your work will support processes and decisions that reach millions of customers and you will gain the experience (and satisfaction!) that only facing problems that you’ve never seen before and overcoming new challenges can bring.
 



Your role




  As a data scientist your main responsibilities will involve work collaboratively on building models and analyses to support internal products or the business’s decision processes, producing code and experiments that be reproducible and maintainable as well as informing the group’s digital strategy.
 



  What does that mean in practice?
 



  It means that over the course of just a few months you may be testing computer vision models to assess the damage of a car accident from a photo; you may be tasked with detecting faulty instruments on a factory floor from the data produced by IoT sensors; you may be processing logs to profile web users; or employ large language models to search for concepts through thousands of risk assessment reports, or optimize the condition offerings in our policies. If you thought that the reach of a data scientist within an insurance company would be limited, think again.
 



  Nor should the value that a skilled data scientist can bring be confined to the technical realm! You’ll have the chance to advise core teams with global reach on their digitalization strategy, shape the Group’s AI ethics policies or be involved in every part of the development of a product: from design, to implementation to its financial assessment.
 



  150 years after its foundation, Zurich is still growing and so will your possibilities within it.
 



Your Skills and Experience




  You may have experience building risk scoring models in a bank or studying behavioural patterns in social psychology trials. Perhaps in your free time you have analysed smart contract transaction patterns on crypto platforms. Or you were once asked to optimise the routing of logistical services or the hourly rental price of courts in a tennis club. Maybe during your studies you spent time filtering the massive amount of data produced by particle physics experiments and you now recall with fondness long, late night conversations around the interpretation of p-values. You may have built a system to detect unconscious decision patterns in a corpus of court sentences. It could be that you got tired of always getting the same recommendations on your music streaming platform and tried to reverse-engineer their algorithm. Perhaps you’ve wondered how to use mobile phone signal data to design new bus routes or study how crowds move to optimize the floor layout of a department store.
 



  It doesn’t matter where you come from. The essence of our work is easy: make sense of information; maintain a global perspective (it’s not just about the mathematical model, but rather how it’ll be used); write good code.
 



  As a data scientist your skills and qualifications will ideally include:
 



3 years of relevant industry experience (it should be clear by now what we mean by that). If that comes with knowledge of the insurance industry, all the better!
You know your random forest from your logistic regression – and you can explain them clearly to every kind of audience.
You have built a sound knowledge of programming in Python and its most common libraries and frameworks useful for DS (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, numpy, networkx, pytorch, keras, pymc3…).
You have hands-on experience with (Py)Spark and can write non-trivial SQL queries,
Have worked in cloud environments, particularly Azure and AWS
And software versioning systems such as Git or SVN are no strangers to you.
You can prove that you can organise, conduct and communicate the results of quantitative experiments;
That you can handle multiple workflows at once, evaluate priorities, work under pressure
And that you work with autonomy and rigour: even in the face of ambiguity, uncertain requirements and lack of information, you plan and get work done.
You can communicate clearly, effectively and empathically 
And you know what it means to work in a team.
It goes without saying: in a global organization, fluency in English (written and spoken) is paramount. Additional languages surely won’t hurt.





  Bonus points if you can also show:
 



Higher academic education
Knowledge of software engineering basics
Demonstrable experience with seeing your models deployed to production
Experience programming in Scala and R (or indeed some lower-level languages!)
Knowledge of MLOps
Real-world experience with deep learning models
Knowledge of DS platforms such as Dataiku, Knime, DataRobot, H2O etc.





Additional Information




As well as a competitive salary and a yearly bonus we offer benefits package which includes:




Option to work remotely within Spain even up to 100% - you choose
Flexible working hours
Wide range of internal and external trainings
Free English, German and Spanish classes depending on the needs
Ticket restaurant
Life Insurance
Pension Plan - after 1 year in the company
Referral bonus if you bring other talented people like you
Special banking and insurance conditions
Exclusive Employees discounts





Primary work location is Barcelona, Poblenou. Please apply with your CV in English.
 



Who we are




  Looking for a challenging and inspiring work environment where you can make a difference? At Zurich millions of individuals and businesses place their trust in our products and services every day. Our 53,000 employees worldwide form the basis of our success, enabling businesses and communities to face a world of risk with confidence. Imagine if you could help people do this all over the world.

Business Analyst - Private Equity & Principal Investors,McKinsey & Company,"Madrid, Madrid provincia","


Who You'll Work With


     You will be based in our Madrid office as part of our Private Equity & Principal Investors (PEPI) practice. Our practice is the world’s leading advisor to the PEPI industry and a high growth area for the firm, working with many of the most significant global and local private investors and their portfolio companies.
    


      You will work in teams and directly with our clients. You will also work with the wider McKinsey network including a range of experts in the firm, from industry and functional experts to data scientists to researchers to software and app designers.
    



     McKinsey believes in strengths-based development and coaching, and you’ll receive frequent mentoring from colleagues. This will include a senior colleague from your office or practice who will help you grow and achieve your career goals. Additionally, you will have a professional development manager who will manage staffing to help you choose projects based on your priorities as well as the needs of client service teams. When you join McKinsey, you are joining a firm that will invest in your professional development.
   




What You'll Do

    You will work in teams to support private investor clients and their portfolio companies throughout the deal lifecycle including diligence, value creation topics and exit support.
   


     In this role, you will have the opportunity to assess and identify market attractiveness, provide targeted information and specialized financial analysis on potential acquisitions as well as prepare and deliver high-impact communication of your synthesized findings. You will also have the opportunity to work directly with portfolio companies on their value creation agenda, spanning a diverse set of topics as well as be a subject matter expert on topics related to our service to investors. You will be recognized as a valuable resource of experience, information and expertise both inside the firm and by our clients.
   


     You will receive training on how to better structure ambiguous problems and take action to solve them as well as synthesize clear takeaways from complex information into clear takeaways and recommendations using both qualitative and quantitative method. You will work effectively with diverse teams to come up with the best solution and move people and organizations to act. You will establish trust-based relationships with clients to better-serve their organizations, communicate effectively with all audiences including senior leaders and develop your leadership style, leveraging your own passions, strengths and personal values.
   


     During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a business analyst on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of private investor settings across different industry and functional areas and develop significant business experience as well as an investor mindset. You will likely intersect with many elements of our firm’s work including digital, implementation, and tech and analytics capabilities.
   


     Your role differs from McKinsey’s generalist business analyst role in its focus. Your role will focus entirely on serving investor clients and their portfolio companies (though because our clients invest across sectors and types of companies, the role still offers exposure to a wide variety of sectors and functional levers). PEPI consultants will be staffed full time to client engagements.

 Lo que hacemos
 Hoy en día, alrededor del 50% de los ensayos clínicos se retrasan debido al reclutamiento de pacientes, ya que la recopilación de datos de pacientes se realiza de forma manual. Como resultado, la investigación clínica es altamente ineficiente tanto en tiempo como en costo, por lo que lleva años y miles de millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo medicamento.
 Este problema podría resolverse a través de datos del mundo real, es decir, aquellos contenidos en las historias clínicas electrónicas (HCE). Pero desafortunadamente, hasta el 85% de los datos clínicos existentes no están estructurados, es decir, en texto plano.
 IOMED ha encontrado la solución a esta situación, haciendo posible aprovechar al máximo el valor de los datos clínicos del mundo real. Desarrollamos una herramienta que extrae los datos necesarios de los textos clínicos, lo que da como resultado una base de datos estructurada, estandarizada e interoperable que contiene la información clínica completa de los hospitales.
 De este modo, la información no reutilizable se transforma en datos disponibles para la Investigación clínica, lo que permite incrementar la cantidad de pacientes que cumplen con los criterios, así como reducir el tiempo total y el trabajo manual dedicado a esta tarea.

Un proyecto del que formarías parte al 100 y del cual queremos que ayudes a conceptualizar desarrollar y ver crecer. Puedes echarle un vistazo al MVP en el App Store y seguro que se te ocurren un par de ideas para echarle chispas. 

 Y es que este proyecto ya tiene su rodaje empresas como Pfizer Fundación Pfizer BIC Araba SPRI The Cube Diputación Foral de Álava Ayuntamiento de Vitoria-Gasteiz Fundación Vital Álava Emprende Inizia y UPV-EHU nos avalan y creen en él tanto como nosotros que lo hemos desarrollado conceptualizado y lanzado. Incluso inaugurado el laboratorio de Innovación de Pfizer en España si los de las vacunas. 

 Pero bueno vayamos al grano... 

 Buscamos a dos desarrolladores de aplicaciones móviles (iOS y/o Android) y un Data Scientist que nos ayuden a llevar Cori (https //cori.care) al siguiente nivel.

Bioinformatician - Precision Tox,Center for Genomic Regulation,"Barcelona, Barcelona provincia","




The Institute
 The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an international biomedical research institute of excellence, based in Barcelona, Spain, with more than 400 scientists from 44 countries. The CRG is composed by an interdisciplinary, motivated and creative scientific team which is supported both by a flexible and efficient administration and by high-end and innovative technologies.
 In April 2021, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) received the renewal of the 'HR Excellence in Research' Award from the European Commission. This is a recognition of the Institute's commitment to developing an HR Strategy for Researchers, designed to bring the practices and procedures in line with the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (Charter and Code).
 Please, check out our Recruitment Policy
 The role
 PrecisionTox is an European funded project, the overarching aim of which is to establish a new, 3Rs- compliant (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement), cost-effective testing paradigm for chemical safety assessment — Precision Toxicology — that revolutionizes regulatory toxicology, replaces animal testing, reduces uncertainty, and determines safety factors in assessing risks to human health. This goal will be accomplished by identifying molecular key event (KE) biomarkers, predictive of chemically induced adverse health effects in humans, that feed directly into regulatory and industry practice via the systematic use of distantly related animal species from across the tree of life and the highly interdisciplinary mix of genomics, metabolomics, evolutionary theory, quantitative genetics, data science, toxicology, and law.
 Within this project, our group at the CRG focuses on the analysis of bulk and single cell RNA-seq from five different model species (Danio, Xenopus, Caenorhabditis, Daphnia and Drosophila) after treatment with selected putative cardio, neuro, and hepatotoxic compounds emerging from other efforts within PhyloTox. Our aim is to employ existing and developing novel approaches-including Machine Learning Methods, to predict the impact in human of the chemical compounds, based on the impact that they have in the transcriptomes of the model species (in particular by predicting the impact on co-expression networks). This project fits overall within a larger overarching goal in our group of developing methods to relate genome to phenome across the tree of life.
 The Computational Biology of RNA Processing Group of CRG is recruiting a Bioinformatician to work in the PrecisionTOX-funded project to analyse sex determination during Daphnia magna embryogenesis. The principal duties of the Bioinformatician will involve conducting analysis of a large RNA-Seq dataset generated from Daphnia magna collected at different developmental stages and benchmarking different bioinformatic tools for performing differential gene expression analysis on time and sex determination to understand the epigenetic mechanisms leading to these processes in Daphnia magna.
 About Guigo’s lab
 The overarching theme of the research in our lab is the understanding of the information encoded in genomic sequences, and how this information is processed in the pathway leading from DNA to protein sequences. More specifically, we are interested in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and RNA processing, the relationship between molecular phenotypes and higher order endophenotypes and organismal phenotypes, and the identification of functional regions on the genome of all living beings. Our group is mostly computational, and we do both large scale data analysis and development of methods, but it has also an important experimental component. We participate in many large scale international functional genomics projects, such as ENCODE, GTEx, BluePrint and others.
 Whom would we like to hire?
 Professional experience
 Must Have

You have high-throughput genomics projects involving data analysis and interpretation
You have experience with transcriptomic analysis
You have experience with bioinformatics methods: Analysis of RNASeq data
You have previous experience working in HPC infrastructure

Senior Data Scientist,King.com,"Barcelona, Barcelona provincia","
Craft: Data, Analytics & Strategy
 
 Job Description:
 Do you want to work on a fun mobile game which is loved by players around the world? Working in a talented team alongside developers, designers, artists, and other passionate data scientists, you’ll see your work being played by millions.

 We’re currently looking for a talented and experienced Senior Data Scientist to join our Portfolio Live Games organization in the Pet Rescue Saga team.

 Your role within the Kingdom

 As a Senior Data Scientist in the Pet Rescue Saga, you will be working with varied stakeholders in a fun, dynamic and fast- paced environment. You’ll help us to further understand, model, predict, segment and retain our players.

 Specifically you will:


 Translate business needs to technical requirements and AB- tests, then work with development teams to ensure correct implementation and tracking



 Perform analysis of complex scenarios and AB- tests, both systematically and on a one- off basis



 Carefully check, debug, and problem solve issues to ensure you deliver accurate and clear analysis and reports, even when confronted by subtle data complications



 Provide an analytics perspective to discussions and helping to drive the priorities within your team



 Work closely with other Data Scientists across the business to leverage insights from one game across multiple games



 Help evolve the methodology and tools available to King’s data science community



 Champion data within the team, and share your knowledge with the wider Data Science community


 Required skills to create thrills

 You have a passion for quantitative analysis, understanding player behavior and will have the ability to draw business insights which will add real value to King. You will need to demonstrate the ability to learn quickly and will have worked in a fast- paced and collaborative environment. This role will involve working with teams and individuals across King - such as Game Developers, Producers and Game Artists, so broad communication skills are essential. You will also need:


 Product insight: You will need to combine an understanding of player behavior based on the data with the ability to understand the problems in our game and business, in order to provide the best recommendations and decisions.



 Technical skills: We make intensive usage of SQL, cloud services, R, and the Python analytical stack, so having prior experience in at least two of these domains is definitely a plus. A good grasp of applied statistics (especially to time series) might also be very helpful.



 Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualizing or reporting your results/analysis so they are clear and unambiguous. Your insights will need to be digested by people with diverse degrees of numerical proficiency, so getting the right message across to different audiences is a very interesting challenge.


 There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in the areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.

 Specific prior experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes:


 Experience in the games industry or similarly sophisticated customer- facing digital businesses



 Cloud- based big data solutions such as Redshift, BigQuery 
Behavioral psychology/economics



 Robust understanding of more advanced statistical techniques suitable for analysis of highly skewed populations



 Experience in predictive analytics, segmentation, and related areas



 Experience in experimental design



 Software engineering skills in languages beyond R and Python which we use most frequently



 Standard reporting tools such as Looker/Tableau/etc.

Ph.D position: Complex Causality in Aging,Center for Genomic Regulation,"Barcelona, Barcelona provincia","




The Institute
 The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an international biomedical research institute of excellence, based in Barcelona, Spain, with more than 400 scientists from 44 countries. The CRG is composed by an interdisciplinary, motivated and creative scientific team which is supported both by a flexible and efficient administration and by high-end and innovative technologies.
 In April 2021, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) received the renewal of the 'HR Excellence in Research' Award from the European Commission.

 Please, check out our Recruitment Policy
 The role
 The molecular mechanisms driving aging are embedded in complex physiologic networks. At long time-scales, these mechanisms exhibit emergent, collective behaviour that is both a fascinating topic and a fundamental barrier for traditional experimental approaches to establish molecular-level causality. To understand biological aging and develop effective therapies against it, we need better and more quantitative approaches that can rapidly characterize the multiple, complex causal pathways through which molecular-level changes determine systems-level dynamics.
 The Dynamics of Living Systems group is an interdisciplinary team that pursues these goals through a mix of molecular genetics, synthetic biology, high-throughput imaging, machine learning, modelling, and math.

 We are currently looking for two candidate profiles:


Students interested in wet-lab experiments, with a masters degree in genetics, genomics, biomedical engineering, or molecular biology
 And/or
      

Students interested in computational work, with a masters in engineering statistics, physics, computer science or bioinformatics

       The successful candidate will:
      

Collaborate on the development of novel experimental and computational methods to study the genetics and molecular physiology of aging.
Develop new functional genomics approaches for measuring change at the single cell, individual, and population level.
Work with C. elegans as a fast-aging and genetically tractable model for prototyping approaches that can be transferred to vertebrate models and humans.
Engage in close wet-lab / dry-lab collaborations to develop new experimental methods
Join in regular journal clubs, departmental data clubs, and institutional symposia
Work with the lab’s high-throughput imaging technology “The Lifespan Machine”.
Interact with colleagues the CNAG (centro nacional de análisis genómico) Single Cell Genomics Team and CRG Genomics Core, as well as colleagues located in biology, physics, and engineering departments at multiple institutes and universities across Barcelona.


 About the team
 We are a small, international team that combines expertise in genetics, molecular biology, physics, computational biology, and engineering. We are based in the EMBL/CRG Systems Biology Unit in Barcelona, Spain, which is an unusually great place to live and do science. We build and apply new technologies that allow us to collect the data needed to build quantitatively rigorous models of physiology.

3-year employment contract startin in November 2022 (flexible), with the possibility of an extra year extension. The project is about spin transition studies on engineered bio-hybrids for the development of new photonic tools, funded by the La Caixa Junior Leader program, and supervised by Sara H. Mejías (www.sarahmejias.com) and Juan Cabanillas (www.juancabanillas.wixsite.com/research).
 Project Description
 A sustainable future starts with efficient light-energy conversion. In particular, light-induced spin transitions are essential to harness the power of the light in applications like catalysis, light energy storage, or memory development. However, a challenge is still to overcome the energy losses that arise from competing decay paths after photon absorption, making molecular spin transitions inefficient.
 This thesis will develop bio-hybrids with customizable spin transitions combining engineered proteins and photoactive molecules. In the lab, we will synthesize bio-hybrids with different structures and study their excited state dynamics using different spectroscopic techniques, including femtosecond transient absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence. This strategy allows to study the light conversion principles and optimize them for the desired application.
 Position profile

Bachelor of Physics, Physical Chemistry, Biophysics, or similar.
Master in area related to the position duties, preferably in physical chemistry, biophysics, or Nanoscience.
High level of English, both oral and written.
Ability to work in a team.

Valuables

Experience according to the profile, particularly in time-resolved spectroscopic techniques as transient absorption or photoluminiscence measurements.
Experience in molecular biology, protein purification, and chromatography.

What is offered for the candidate
 The proposed project will offer the PhD a unique training opportunity at the interface of spectroscopy, physical chemistry, molecular biology, and Nanoscience. Specifically, the proposed project will greatly increase the PhD student's portfolio of scientific know-how on the pump-probe spectroscopic characterization of exciton dynamics in bio-hybrid materials, including data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. Besides, the candidate will receive training in the fabrication of engineered proteins and bio-hybrids systems, including protein synthesis and purification. We will offer the PhD student a detailed on-the-job introduction, including continuous mentoring through the PhD training. The student will also have the possibility to supervise undergraduate students. We have active collaborations with national and international researchers, which the PhD student and the research project will take advantage of.
 Research environment

 …Working with top-talented and amazing Good Rebels!
 
We are good, non-conformist rebels: we question the status quo and reject ""that’s the way it’s always been done"", therefore promoting constant change. We look for the greatest positive impact on the planet, and we know we have the power to create a new reality.
 We are owners, so we take initiative and bring solutions to the table. We are humble learners and know that being under construction is fine. We help each other grow through feedback showing uncompromising transparency and vulnerability. . We value other points of view because we know that a diversity of opinions makes us greater.
 We are constantly learning, and we thrive on understanding each other better every day, on putting ourselves in someone else's shoes.
 None of this would make sense if we didn’t enjoy the journey. We smile and celebrate every day because we are passionate about our work and our mission.
 We think big and bold and are always looking for the “WOW” in everything we do, and we work to exceed everyone’s expectations (colleagues, customers, consumers, and society).
 We exist to boost nonconformism and empower people to change the food system into a sustainable one, protecting what we ️ the most: the animals, people’ health, our planet and our culinary heritage.
 Heura is a plant-based startup from Barcelona founded by Marc Coloma and Bernat Añaños in April 2017. Heura was born to bring a solution that will leave the current food system obsolete and accelerate the shift to a world where the animals are out of the meat production equation.
 Our Mediterranean culinary heritage is reflected on their products: short label, high nutritional facts and taste.
 Meat & Planet lovers.
 Proudly Mediterranean ️

 Diversity and inclusion are important to us, and we’re constantly working to improve these aspects. At Heura, we don’t just accept our differences, we fully support and celebrate them.
 We’re committed to equal opportunity employment regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender, or gender identity or expression. We strive to be an equal opportunity workplace.

 If you see yourself here and can meet the essential requirements, we would love for you to apply. Or, do you know someone who would be a perfect fit? Let them know!

PhD Candidate: Alloying Type Electrodes for High-Performance Batteries
Short description:PhD position in fabrication and mechanistic studies of alloy-type electrodes for battery applications
Description:  The next battery generation envisaged is based on high capacity electrodes, either with liquid or solid electrolytes. Great advancements have been lately achieved in production of high-capacity electrodes; however, the practical challenges of using such electrodes (e.g., high Si content or Li-based anodes with long cycling performance) yet to be addressed. Such enhanced performance first require a better understanding of the charge storage and failure processes involved and tune the cell components’ compositions and properties accordingly.  The concept of the project is to understand the charge storage propagation/mechanism in alloying-type active materials (e.g., Si electrodes) and develop strategies to enhance their performance, especially in terms of cyclability.  This project deals with fabrication and studying alloying type electrodes (e.g., Si) for battery applications. Various types and formats of alloying materials including networks of nanowires produced using a new process developed by the group (i.e., grown at ultra-fast rates floating in the gas phase from an aerosol of catalyst nanoparticles) will be evaluated. The overall aim of the PhD is to determine reaction mechanisms and phenomena governing the charge storage and failure of the electrodes during and over cycling. Accordingly, advanced techniques like in-situ and/or in-operando measurements (Raman and X-ray scattering), titration gas chromatography, and various characterization techniques, like electron microscopies (SEM, HRTEM, etc.), will be employed. One of the objectives is to study the alloying reaction mechanism with an emphasis on dry electrodes, and tune the electrodes’ physicochemical properties to boost the performance (e.g., rate capability and cyclability). Another objective is to develop new strategies via surface engineering to mitigate the electrochemical degradation in the electrode-electrolyte interface. The student will continuously help in the design and fabrication of state-of the art active materials and electrode structures for batteries. He/she will perform extensive experiments for fabrication of electrodes, electrolytes, and small lab-size battery cells and will work with atmosphere controlled glove-boxes; regularly conduct multi-scale materials characterization measurements, for example through electron microscopy, spectroscopic techniques and advanced X-ray diffraction. He/she will extensively use electrochemical apparatus/techniques. The PhD student will work in a very collaborative team, funded by an ERC Consolidator Grant. A short secondment in a laboratory of European collaborators is likely.  The successful candidate will receive high-quality training upon their incorporation. Should be self-organized and capable to collect/analyze large amount of data, prepare regular reports and inform their supervisor(s) about the work progress in regular meetings. Will be expected to absorb new information fast, have problem-solving and questioning mindset as soft skills.   Dissemination of the results in project meetings, publications, participating in conferences, etc. is one of the general objective of the project. 
Requirements: 
                        
Master’s and undergraduate degree in a discipline related to electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, nanofabrication, materials science or related field.
Strong interest in experimental work is essential.
Previous experience on electrochemical systems, batteries, alloying reactions (electrochemical), familiarity with potentiostats/galvanostats and/or preparation of solid-state electrolyte, fabrication of electrodes and devices will be positively evaluated.
Command of written and spoken English is a prerequisite.

Conditions: 
                        
Screening of candidates will begin immediately. Short-listed candidates will be invited for an initial interview via Zoom, even before the closing date.
Interested candidates are encouraged to apply as soon as possible to ensure best consideration of their application.
The expected start date is September 1st 2022 (depending on availability).
The position includes a full-time contract with social security coverage.

The techniques to be used will include third-generation sequencing technologies (library preparation, nanopore sequencing, RNA extraction), molecular biology techniques (western blot, qPCR), cell culturing (mostly mammalian), analysis of protein translation (ribosome profiling, polysome profiling).
 The candidate will also be in charge of the general organization and maintenance of the lab supplies, coordination of laboratory safety and inventory, and placement of purchasing orders using Oracle system.
 The candidate will provide support to current ongoing research projects in the lab, as well be involved in the development of novel techniques in close collaboration with other lab members.
 The candidate will also have a project of their own to be discussed with the PI related to the research lines of the lab, if this is of interest to the candidate.
 About the lab
 Our lab is focused on deciphering the role that RNA modifications play in a large variety of cellular contexts, including the development of novel technologies to map RNA modifications. In our lab, we are employing a combination of experimental (RNASeq, RIP-Seq polysome profiling, mouse/cell knockouts, Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing) and computational techniques (NGS data analysis, algorithm development, machine learning), to unveil the secrets of three post-transcriptional regulatory layers: the epitranscriptome, RNA structure and ribosome specialization.
 Our laboratory has been pioneer in the use of native RNA nanopore sequencing to study RNA modifications, including the development of novel algorithms to map and quantify RNA modifications using nanopore sequencing (Liu et al, Nature Comm 2019; Begik et al, Nature Biotech 2021) as well as novel protocols to improve the applicability of nanopore technologies towards low-input patient-derived samples (Smith et al, Genome Res 2020; Begik et al, bioRxiv 2021). Our lab is currently applying these novel methods to decipher the biological functions of the ‘uncharted epitranscriptome’ (Novoa et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2017) and to understand why and how the dysregulation of RNA modifications contributes to diverse human diseases (Begik et al., Genome Biol 2020; Jonkhout et al., RNA Biol 2021), such as cancer, intellectual disabilities and diet-induced metabolic disorders that are passed via epigenetic intergenerational inheritance mechanisms.
 We are a young lab of 10 people who are very enthusiastic about our work and care about having a good laboratory environment. We look for people that will create good lab dynamics and positive thinking. All candidates will also meet the lab members before being offered any formal offer.

Context And Mission




      The Life Sciences Department from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center seeks a team leader to establish a new team on Health Data Research within the Life Sciences Department that will collaborate closely with the INB/ELIXIR-ES unit. The selected candidate will work on the acquisition, normalisation and standardisation of Health Research Data, potentially incorporate new members to the team in the near future, and drive projects in the area in close collaboration with domain experts in the clinic (collaborators).
      
 This position is in the context of the massive amount of health data available for research in the last years and the recent efforts at national and European levels to tap on those data to benefit patients. Using such data helps scientists to understand diseases and health conditions better and provides new ways of identifying patients at higher risk. It also helps of preventing illness and of providing better treatments. This, in turn, improves health services' efficiency, optimising their resources where they matter the most. In the COVID-19 pandemic, using health data for research has enabled clinicians to quickly adapt to the new treatments available for critically ill patients and decision-makers to provide better urgent responses at different levels.
       Recent efforts have been oriented towards the re-use of health data for research (secondary use), for which the adoption of FAIR principles in the health data life cycle is essential. Projects such as HealthyCloud (https://healthycloud.eu/), at the European level, and IMPaCT-Data (https://www.isciii.es/QueHacemos/Financiacion/IMPaCT/Paginas/Plan.aspx), at the Spanish level, co-led and led by the BSC respectively, are contributing to such endeavour.
       The candidate will implement a project to accelerate the potential of biomedical research to advance human health, scaling up and further bringing together two initiatives: (i) at the international data-stewardship level, the European Genome-phenome Archive (https://ega-archive.org/); and (ii) at the local health research level, a unique pilot on shared computational infrastructures –known as StarLife– shared between three flagship research centres (BSC, CRG and IRB).
       The selected candidate will work in a highly sophisticated HPC environment, have access to state-of-the-art systems and computational infrastructures, and establish collaborations with experts in different areas both at international and local levels.

Independent Research Fellows at the Barcelona Collaboratoriu...,Center for Genomic Regulation,"Barcelona, Barcelona provincia","




The Institute
 The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an international biomedical research institute of excellence, based in Barcelona, Spain, with more than 400 scientists from 44 countries. The CRG is composed by an interdisciplinary, motivated and creative scientific team which is supported both by a flexible and efficient administration and by high-end and innovative technologies.
 In April 2021, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) received the renewal of the 'HR Excellence in Research' Award from the European Commission. This is a recognition of the Institute's commitment to developing an HR Strategy for Researchers, designed to bring the practices and procedures in line with the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (Charter and Code).
 Please, check out our Recruitment Policy
 The CRG and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory have created the ‘Barcelona Collaboratorium for Modelling and Predictive Biology’, an exciting new initiative that will kick off with an inaugural symposium, “Programmable Life” on the 4-5th of October.
 About the Barcelona Collaboratorium for Modelling and Predictive Biology
 The Barcelona Collaboratorium for Modelling and Predictive Biology is a new space for computational and theoretical biology launched as a joint initiative of two leading life science institutes - the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and EMBL Barcelona. The open plan space is designed to promote collaboration, the sharing of ideas, and synergy across disciplines and scales. Each area of biology has its own unique features, but concepts and tools from one discipline can provide important fresh insights and new perspectives into another. Our focus is to bring together experts from different disciplines, into the same space, from molecular, cellular and tissue biology, up to epidemiology and ecosystems. The Collaboratorium will start in September 2022 with an inaugural symposium on Programmable Life (October 4-5).
 The 21st century has seen a revolution in biology. We can sequence whole genomes cheaply and fast, image the dynamics of gene activity from microscopic bacteria up to the whole human body, and precisely modify the DNA of almost any organism. This is creating vast quantities of molecular data, and giving us the tantalising hope of being able to control, repair and engineer living systems.
 However, these impressive technical advances have not yet translated into an ability to accurately control, or even to accurately predict, the behaviour of most real living systems. Biology is complex, and a remaining revolution is still ahead of us: to make biology predictable and controllable – from the design of new proteins and the repair of human organs, up to the prediction of whole ecosystems. Data-generation is no longer the primary concern – technologies for quantitative data generation continue to improve at break-neck speed, both in quality and quantity. The deeper concern now is a lack of theoretical and computational tools to understand and predict complex biology – across all relevant scales.
 The Collaboratorium will host independent research fellows, postdoctoral and doctoral researchers working with local groups and both short term and extended visits by international leaders in the fields of theoretical biology, artificial intelligence/machine learning, complex systems, physics of life, computer science and engineering.
 The role: Independent Research Fellows
 Collaboratorium Fellows are faculty-level appointments suitable for original and ambitious researchers in modelling and predictive biology, including researchers seeking independence immediately after completion of their PhD or after a period of postdoctoral research.
 Applicants may have a background in any relevant discipline (including computer science, physics, mathematics, engineering or biological sciences) and should be interested in working in a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment of individual researchers, visitors and small teams. Fellows will be provided with space suitable for a team of maximum 3 researchers. Collaborating with local or international experimental laboratories is encouraged but purely theoretical and computational work is also suitable. Fellows can work on biological systems at any scale from individual molecules to networks, cells, tissues, organs and ecosystems.
 In addition to conducting cutting-edge research in modelling and predictive biology, Collaboratorium Fellows are also expected to participate in and organise internal seminars and Collaboratorium activities,
 Interested candidates are also encouraged to apply for La Caixa Junior Leader Fellowships 2023 (https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/postdoctoral-fellowships-junior-leader-incoming).
 Languages

You have excellent command of spoken and written English

 Technical skills & Experience

You are innovative and have original research record relevant to the ambitions of the Collaboratorium in Modelling and Predictive Biology

 The Offer – Working Conditions

Contract duration: 3 years with the possibility of a 2-year extension after evaluation.
Estimated annual gross salary: Salary is commensurate with qualifications and consistent with our pay scales.
Target start date: Before the end of 2022.

 We provide a highly stimulating environment with state-of-the-art infrastructures, and unique professional career development opportunities. To check out our training and development portfolio, please visit our website in the training section.
 We offer and promote a diverse and inclusive environment and welcomes applicants regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.
 The CRG is committed to reconcile a work and family life of its employees and is offering extended vacation period and the possibility to benefit from flexible working hours.

Post-doctoral positions in novel ultrafast spectroscopy meth...,The Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO),"Castelldefels, Barcelona provincia","

ICFO is offering 2 postdoctoral positions to well-qualified, highly motivated and dynamic young scientists who wish to enhance their scientific career in a friendly and stimulating environment. 
The successful candidates will be joining the Photon Harvesting in Plants and Biomolecules group led by Prof. Dr. Nicoletta Liguori. 
Our group combines state-of-the-art methods in experimental ultrafast spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations:

 We develop and apply novel ultrafast spectroscopic methods aimed at uncovering how changes in light, environment and structure switch the function of photoactive systems on and off.  
We obtain structural information of the different steps of such molecular switches by developing and applying molecular dynamics simulations approaches at different levels of temporal and spatial resolution.



 The two postdoctoral researchers will be involved, respectively, in:

 Position 1. Applying a novel ultrafast multipulse spectroscopic method recently developed by the group to study how photosynthetic organisms activate photoprotection in real time, in order to survive under natural fluctuating sunlight conditions. The candidate will further extend this novel method to study the activation of photoprotection from a few femtoseconds up to above the second, and from isolated proteins (in vitro) up to in vivo conditions. 
 Position 2. Developing the next generation of our novel ultrafast multipulse spectroscopic approaches that will allow - for the first time - to uncover how and how fast changes in: i) temperature or ii) the availability of substrates, regulate the activation of photoactive systems involved in plant and animal bioenergetic processes.



 Both positions are focused on experimental, spectroscopic work. However, the successful candidates will extensively collaborate with the other group members involved in exploring the same processes via molecular dynamics simulations. If wished, there is the possibility (but is not necessary) for both candidates to also actively join the computational work.
 The PI has received funding from multiple prestigious, national grants from the Netherlands and Spain to develop the project and the successful candidates will be embedded in a large network of international collaborations (NL, ES, IT, PT, UK, DE). The successful candidates will receive full support and help from the group leader in applying for independent funding if wished (positions are however already fully funded up to 3 years each). Amongst other things, both successful candidates will be extensively involved in writing scientific publications, supervising students and in dissemination at national and international conferences and visits and collaborations with laboratories across the world.

Share this opening!
Use the following URL: https://jobs.icfo.eu/?detail=692 



Candidates must hold an internationally-recognized Ph.D.-equivalent degree (or evidence of its completion in the nearest future) preferably in physics, chemistry, biophysics, optics, material science or similar. Extensive knowledge of biophysics and/or photochemistry will be highly valued.
 Both postdoctoral researchers will be involved in the building and development of complex ultrafast multipulse spectroscopic setups, especially based on the electronic synchronization of multiple, brand new custom-made femtosecond and nanosecond laser systems. We will probe ultrafast changes in the ground and excited state of a variety of photoactive systems mainly in the UV-VIS to near-IR region, using pumps that range from the UV up to the near-IR. Therefore, previous experience working in the visible (probe) with pumps ranging from the UV-VIS to the near-IR and from the femtosecond to the nanosecond will be positively valued.
 Both candidates should have a proven track record in ultrafast spectroscopy with strong, independent hands-on experience in building and developing complex ultrafast laser setups. Hands-on experience on programming acquisition software tools (in particular, but not necessarily, in LabVIEW) will be considered a strong plus. 
Depending on the position, previous experience and knowledge in:

 Position 1. ultrafast processes in natural and artificial photosynthesis and light-harvesting regulation  
Position 2. non-equilibrium ultrafast spectroscopic methods (e.g. pH-jump or temperature-jumps IR methods), will be considered a strong plus.



 Previous experience in data analysis of time-resolved data (e.g. global analysis) will be positively valued as well as previous experience in handling of in vitro (possibly biological) samples and working in a wet lab. Samples will be provided by international collaborators.
 ICFO is an equal opportunity employer. Candidates are selected exclusively on merit and potential on the basis of submitted application material. No restrictions related to disabilities, citizenship or gender apply to ICFO positions. ICFO abides by the principles of openness, efficiency, transparency, supportiveness, and international comparability as stated in the European Charter for Researchers and the European Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
 Salary is offered according to the institutional salary scales. 
The contract is offered for periods of 1 year, renewable for a total of up to 3 years.
 Additionally, a family allowance is also available on request and after corresponding approval for people with family charges in the terms described in the corresponding policy.



Suitable candidates are requested to submit:

 Presentation letter with a declaration of interest, 
 Curriculum Vitae, including contact details, 
 The contact e-mail of two potential referees.



 Candidates will be assessed as they apply and the call will remain open until the suitable candidate is identified.
 Candidates may contact jobs@icfo.eu for formal enquiries regarding the application, as well as address scientific enquiries to Nicoletta.Liguori@icfo.eu.

Context And Mission




      The Global Health Resilience (GHR) Team led by ICREA Research Professor Rachel Lowe at the BSC-CNS is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral scientist to conduct cutting-edge methodological research on tracking past, present and future risk of climate-sensitive diseases and developing robust data-driven modelling approaches to predict the risk of outbreaks from sub-seasonal to decadal time scales. 
      
 The mission of GHR Team is to apply a transdisciplinary approach to co-designing policy-relevant methodological solutions, to enhance surveillance, preparedness and response to climate-sensitive disease outbreaks and health outcomes. The team conducts cutting-edge methodological research on disentangling the impacts of global environmental change on infectious disease risk and co-developing impact-based forecasting models at sub-seasonal to decadal timescales in collaboration with public health, disaster risk management, and humanitarian agencies. The GHR Team is part of the Earth System Services Group (ESS) within the Earth Sciences Department, whose mission is to research the impact of weather, atmospheric chemistry and climate upon socio-economic sectors, including renewable energy, agriculture, water management, forest fires, urban development and health and demonstrate the ongoing value of earth system services to society and the economy.
      
 The selected 2 candidates will co-develop infectious disease prediction models using open-source and stakeholder provided data to provide decision-support at multiple spatial scales and different forecasting horizons. The candidates will tackle research questions related to the impact of land use and land change and extreme climatic events on behavioural change and infectious disease outcomes, including vector and water-borne diseases in lower- and middle-income countries and across Europe. The candidates will benefit from interdisciplinary training opportunities tailored to their experience and interests. The research will be positioned within the context of WMO’s Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), whose aim is to provide actionable climate information to key sectors of society. This position presents an opportunity to work alongside a wide range of leading international climate and health scientists delivering cutting-edge climate services for the health sector to inform policy makers in Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, and worldwide. 
      
 Successful candidates will benefit from expert training and BSC-CNS staff benefits: international multidisciplinary scientific environment and advanced applied research training. We encourage applications from highly motivated candidates with demonstrated experience in impact modelling for public health and an interest in applied research in the context of climate and environmental change.

Acerca de IOMED
 IOMED es una empresa tecnológica de nueva creación puntera en el campo de la extracción y el procesamiento masivo de datos médicos. Lo compone un equipo pequeño, unido, joven, dinámico y flexible, que, tras varios años de trabajo en conjunto, se caracteriza por su agilidad, disfrute del trabajo y compenetración. Acorde, buscamos candidatos con ganas de innovar, lanzar un proyecto relevante y crecer con él, siempre disfrutando cada día del trabajo en equipo y de los retos, que son muchos. Nuestro “dream team” está formado por estadísticos, bioinformáticos, gente del mundo de los negocios y la medicina.
 En IOMED los modelos que desarrolles analizarán cientos de millones de textos hospitalarios, ayudando a extraer variables que acelerarán la investigación clínica.
 Como empleador, ofrecemos igualdad de oportunidades. Todavía somos un equipo pequeño y estamos comprometidos a crecer de manera inclusiva. Queremos aumentar nuestro equipo con personas talentosas y dinámicas, independientemente de su raza, color, religión, nacionalidad, sexo, discapacidad física o edad.
 Lo que hacemos
 Hoy en día, alrededor del 50% de los ensayos clínicos se retrasan debido al reclutamiento de pacientes, ya que la recopilación de datos de pacientes se realiza de forma manual. Como resultado, la investigación clínica es altamente ineficiente tanto en tiempo como en costo, por lo que lleva años y miles de millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo medicamento.
 Este problema podría resolverse a través de datos del mundo real, es decir, aquellos contenidos en las historias clínicas electrónicas (HCE). Pero desafortunadamente, hasta el 85% de los datos clínicos existentes no están estructurados, es decir, en texto plano.
 IOMED ha encontrado la solución a esta situación, haciendo posible aprovechar al máximo el valor de los datos clínicos del mundo real. Desarrollamos una herramienta que extrae los datos necesarios de los textos clínicos, lo que da como resultado una base de datos estructurada, estandarizada e interoperable que contiene la información clínica completa de los hospitales.
 De este modo, la información no reutilizable se transforma en datos disponibles para la Investigación clínica, lo que permite incrementar la cantidad de pacientes que cumplen con los criterios, así como reducir el tiempo total y el trabajo manual dedicado a esta tarea.

The successful candidate will be part of the Performance Team, a sub-group in the section of Computational Earth Sciences.
      
 This team, composed of 10 members but steadily growing, performs R&D tasks in the field of Earth System Modelling (ESM) performance: its goal is to identify model bottlenecks and research how to remove them. The team has at its disposal cutting-edge performance tools, able to evaluate and represent different performance metrics. Having identified those areas in the code, the experts in the team proceed to modify them without impacting the final results. Possible solutions can go from using more efficient numerical algorithms to modifying the way the model exploits the HPC infrastructure.

 Why Product Madness?

 Product Madness is so much more than just a Pool table and a foosball game.

 We believe in an honest and transparent approach with our teammates. Company wide weekly Town Halls, All Hands and strategy meetings are just a few ways in which we encourage an open and honest path to achieving complete transparency.

 Despite a pandemic, there isn’t a day where we don’t feel connected to one another.
 With frequent events, workshops, giveaways, slack coffee and donut sessions we have definitely brought on our office culture to this new virtual world of zoom calls.

 We also try to cater for all our staff’s needs – be that a freshly brewed cappuccino made by our professional barista in our free coffee shop or by providing a bountiful supply of tasty snacks to keep us refueled and buzzing.

 We love to organise plenty of social get-togethers and action-packed activity days, be it slipping inside an inflatable bumper ball for a mad session of football zorbing or throwing caution to the wind and traversing giddy treetop rope courses at Go Ape. On top of these team-building activities, our lunch and learn workshops, not to mention the lavish Christmas and summer parties, foster that ‘work hard, play hard’ mantra. Our offices are based in the heart of the metropolises of London and Lviv, surrounded by an abundance of diversity and inspiration to keep those ideas flowing.

 Our Values

 People First We have the deepest respect for our people and their well being. We know they are exceptionally talented and will always have a choice. We want them to re-choose us every day. We are committed to building a culture where each person's voice will always be heard and addressed.



 MAD for More Always improving, innovating and never settling for the existing. We push all boundaries with courage and ambition to become the world’s best games company.



 Champion Together  We excel at what we do but yet remain humble and helpful to our teammates. We champion one another and hold each other to high standards without any egos.



 Globally Inclusive We are all Equal - regardless of the language we speak, where we live, our gender, religion or culture we come from. We want to build a global home, where everyone has the equal opportunity to make an impact.



 Customer Focused We always think from the customer's perspective - be it players or internal customers. Improving their experience and joy is what drives us. Every client's success is our big win!

About BSC




      The Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS) is the leading supercomputing center in Spain. It houses MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, and is a hosting member of the PRACE European distributed supercomputing infrastructure. The mission of BSC is to research, develop and manage information technologies in order to facilitate scientific progress. BSC combines HPC service provision and R&D into both computer and computational science (life, earth and engineering sciences) under one roof, and currently has over 770 staff from 55 countries.
      
 Look at the BSC experience:
       BSC-CNS YouTube Channel
       Let's stay connected with BSC Folks!
     



Context And Mission




      The Department of Earth Sciences of the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre-Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS), BSC-ES henceforth (bsc.es/earth-sciences) is one of the most active groups in air quality and atmospheric composition modeling, climate prediction and climate services in Europe. The department is currently composed of about 80 people, including scientists and technical and support staff, and is structured in four distinct but interacting research groups: Atmospheric Composition (AC), Climate Prediction, Earth System Services (ESS), and Computational Earth Sciences.
      
 The candidate will work together with AC and ESS groups. The AC group aims at better understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric pollutants along with their effects on air quality, weather, and climate. The main objective of the Earth System Services Group (www.bsc.es/ess) is to demonstrate the ongoing value of climate prediction services, atmospheric composition and weather forecasting to both society and economic actors. The group actively works in identifying user needs that will partly guide research in the BSC-ES Department and aims to quantify the impact of weather, climate, aerosols and gaseous pollutants upon socio-economic sectors through the development of user-oriented services that ensure the transfer of the technology developed and the adaptation to a rapidly changing environment, especially of those highly vulnerable to those changes. The group is extremely active in the EC Research Programmes and has collaborated with the industry and public administration in competitive projects and contracts.
      
 ESS and AC groups contribute to a variety of forecasting activities. The dust component of the NMMB-MONARCH runs operationally at the first WMO Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for Atmospheric Sand and Dust Forecast (i.e., the Barcelona Dust Forecast Center, BDFC), and contributes to multi-model ensemble forecasts both at the WMO Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System Regional Center (WMO SDS-WAS RC) for Northern Africa, Middle East and Europe, and the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP). Both WMO Regional Centers are co-hosted by BSC and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). The group also develops and maintains the CALIOPE air quality system (“CALIdad del aire Operacional Para España”), which provides high-resolution air quality forecasts over Europe and Spain using the in-house emission model HERMES. CALIOPE is currently based on the WRF and CMAQ systems, and its transition to using the NMMB-MONARCH is in progress.
      
 The BSC-ES is looking for a postdoc in air quality/atmospheric composition/meteorology modeling willing to do research and provide user-tailored products for different air quality related projects. The position will support the developments to set up this system and will face different and state-of-the-art technologies. Successful candidates will benefit from the training program and BSC-CNS staff benefits: international multidisciplinary scientific environment, advanced research training, and advanced computational facilities. We encourage applications from highly motivated physicists, engineers, mathematicians (and related disciplines) with outstanding qualifications.

Context and Mission

The Lancet Countdown is an independent, international, and multidisciplinary collaboration that monitors the health impacts of climate change, and progress – or lack thereof – in the world’s response. It draws on the expertise of more than 120 climate scientists, economists, energy and transport experts, social and political scientists, public health experts and health professionals, spanning 38 academic and UN institutions. The Lancet Countdown comprises the Global centre, hosted at University College London’s Institute for Global Health and partners with one of the world’s leading medical journals – The Lancet, and four regional centres in Asia (hosted by Tsinghua University in China), South America (hosted by Cayetano Heredia University (UPCH) in Peru), Small Island and Developing States (hosted by University of West Indies in Jamaica), and Europe (hosted by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain).
The Lancet Countdown in Europe was launched on 23 September 2021 as a transdisciplinary research collaboration whose mission is to monitor health and climate change in the European region. Building on the work of the global Lancet Countdown and other regions, it leverages on the wealth of data and cross disciplinary expertise in Europe, to develop high-resolution Europe-specific indicators that explore in further depth aspects of relevance to the region. The initiative mirrors the approach of the global Lancet Countdown and monitors health dimensions of climate change in Europe across five key domains: i) climate change impacts; exposures, and vulnerability; ii) adaptation planning and resilience for health; iii) mitigation actions and health co-benefits; iv) economics and finance; and v) politics and governance. Indicators are refined on an annual basis as new data and better methods become available. This researcher will join our dynamic team in the Urban Environment and Air Pollution research programme at ISGlobal. The researcher will join an international team of researchers and stakeholders in the Climate Action To Advance Healthy Societies in Europe (CATALYSE) project funded by HORIZON Europe (GA 101057131) which is developing novel data and indicators that feed into the Lancet Countdown in Europe.
