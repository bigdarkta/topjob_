You will be working closely with various teams within a business line (Product, Business, Engineering, Design and Data Science) to understand data requirements, identify and track key metrics, and provide data-driven insights. You will also work with stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of new business/product ideas and provide appropriate recommendations. 

A Day In The Life 

Understand business objectives and deepdive into existing data to recommend new product ideas to solve for the most impactful customer problems (pssh .. some top-secret products await you!) 
Use data to identify trends, spot anomalies and deepdive into their root causes 
Use your number-crunching and slide-maker skills to use and present data beyond just numbers. Hone your data storytelling skills through visualisation techniques by building dashboards and presenting insights to a non-technical audience! 
Evaluate the feasibility of developing new products, participate in user researches to validate customer problems 
Align with stakeholders on key product metrics, design and propose experimentation strategies. 
Launch A/B tests, analyze experiment results and provide recommendations 
Design and own frontend and backend data specs for new products, while collaborating with engineering teams to ensure accurate and timely data collection

   COVID-19 Considerations
 

   We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.
 


   In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.
 


   Corporate Security Responsibility
   All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must:
 

 Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
 Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
 Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
 Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

   COVID-19 Considerations
 

   We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.
 


   In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.
 


   Corporate Security Responsibility
   All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must:
 

 Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
 Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
 Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
 Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

CMI Big Data Java Developer(Ref47594),Crédit Agricole CIB,Singapore,"


Description du poste






    About CMI
     Capital Markets IT (CMI) is the IT department within the bank focused on solutions related to Capital Markets. This includes Front Office (FO) booking platforms, Risk Management (RM) control and regulatory reporting systems, financial product and contract valuation systems, and much more. It is the department most directly exposed to the bank’s financial operations.
    
 About MASAI
     MASAI is an ambitious project critical to the Bank’s strategic pivot towards data-centric operations. In the past, separate systems maintained their data separately, modeling the same data in incompatible ways and depending on ad-hoc and sometimes brittle data sharing mechanisms, creating a complex web of interdependent systems and no centralized repository of data. MASAI was initially created to satisfy regulatory requirements set out by the Basel Committee as part of their FRTB capital rules, but quickly became the central focus in the Bank’s push towards a more data-centric approach. It is based on Big Data technology, which allows horizontally-scalable management of data at and beyond the petabyte scale.
    
 About the Position
     As a member of the MASAI project’s development team, you will develop robust processes to ingest huge amounts of data from disparate systems, and build processes that transform and use that data. The core technology used is Apache Spark on top of HDFS, and development is primarily in Java. The position is ideal for someone with a strong interest in data processing and data science: either a confirmed expert in Big Data technologies or a strong developer keen on gaining expertise in that domain.
    
 Qualifications and Profile
     The successful candidate will definitely have:
     At least 8 years of software development experience
     At least 5 years experience working with Java
     A strong understanding of recent Java language features, such as lambdas, streams, and futures
     Good knowledge of algorithms and data structures, with strong fundamentals in complexity analysis
     Strong ability to analyze code – understand execution flow & debug even without access to a debugger
     Experience with Maven, Git, writing and maintaining integration tests
     Strong familiarity with Linux and bash
     Good knowledge of SQL or an SQL-inspired dialect such as HQL

 Hadoop Big data clusters and tech: Spark, Kafka, HDFS, ORC, Hive,
 HBase, YARN, Parquet, Zookeeper
 Jenkins and Ansible
 Jira or a similar issue-tracking system
 The Spring framework and IoC, and particularly Spring Boot and Swagger for restful web services
 Additionally, knowledge of the following would be helpful although it is not required:

Research Assistant (Collaborative Machine Learning),National University of Singapore,Temporarily Remote in Singapore 119077,"
Date: 11-Aug-2022 
Location: Kent Ridge Campus, SG 
Company: National University of Singapore 




Overview


 Collaborative machine learning is an appealing paradigm to build high-quality machine learning (ML) models by training on the data from many parties. However, concerns over trust and security have hindered the sharing of data between organizations. Much efforts have been focused on breaking the “data silos”, but the silos are inherently difficult to break at the data level, as personal or proprietary data are often involved.


We posit that the ML models can be more amenable for sharing as they are inherently more compact and self-contained with purpose-compiled knowledge from the data. Rather than requiring the learning collaborators to contribute their private data, this project will focus on enabling collaborative machine learning through allowing the collaborators to share heterogeneous black-box models, and to be appropriately incentivized based on their self-interests. Given that most current research are focused on the data level, this project will develop new model-centric collaborative machine learning methods, as well as new notions for trustable model-centric sharing and effective model management techniques for real-world model-centric platforms.


This 4-year project will be led by Prof See-Kiong Ng and be conducted by the leading international and inter-disciplinary AI and data science researchers in the institute’s new Trusted Collaborative Machine Learning (Trusted CollabML) Lab. The CollabML Lab is a collaboration between the Institute of Data Science, the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), the School of Law at the Singapore Management University (SMU), as well as the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The project team will design and develop a trustable, operational and legally-compliant model-centric sharing platform, validated with real-world data and applications provided by industry partners. Such a platform will be instrumental for powering a data-driven AI innovation ecosystem for a vibrant digital economy through trusted self-interest-driven sharing of learned machine intelligence.




 The Role




The Research Assistant will be responsible for designing and implementing efficient and robust systems, and applications for algorithms and methodologies based on state-of-the-art research in machine learning and big data for collaborative machine learning.


Responsibilities:

Design and write robust, readable, and reusable code components and applications to implement state-of-the-art research outcomes in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data;
Perform data cleansing and processing for analysis of real-world datasets;
Assists with the editing and preparation of manuscripts, reports and presentations.;
Participate in presentations and demos for exhibiting work at appropriate events





Requirements:



Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science with a focus in AI/Machine Learning/Big Data;
Solid programming and application development skills with experience in Python/Perl/R. Mastery of programming languages such as C/C++/Java, and experience with Tensorflow would be a plus;
Ability to read and understand methodologies in research papers;
Fluent in English and good team-player

These principles guide and help us make decisions as we work to create economic empowerment for the people of Southeast Asia.

 Get to know the Team:
 The Economics team takes on some of the most challenging and fascinating problems at Grab, in Payments, Advertising, Transport, Deliveries and the space around. We apply both qualitative and quantitative techniques to turn data into actions that have a positive impact on our customers, drivers and merchants. We promote a culture where we enjoy raising the bar constantly for ourselves and others, and that strongly supports the freedom to explore and innovate.

 Get to know the Role:
 This role focuses on creating impact by uncovering and exploiting opportunities that lie at the intersection between (i) Grab’s financial services and ads businesses; and (ii) its mobility and deliveries businesses. It offers opportunities for exposure to a wide range of Grab verticals. As Grab’s payments and ads ecosystems become more prevalent and our suite of financial products grows, we are looking to deepen our understanding of our consumers, merchants and drivers to drive business growth and profitability across the organisation. Collaborative projects across teams are common, with opportunities to work across business verticals and with different regional and country teams. These projects often require a combination of data analysis, strategic thinking and idea generation.

 The Day-to-Day Activities:

 Develop a deep, data-driven understanding of our passengers, drivers, and merchants based on econometric analysis, geo-spatial visualizations, user interviews, and cultural understanding of our markets
 Translate this understanding into actionable, creative insights that improve the user experience, strengthen the value proposition and drive profitable growth
 Test and validate insights via rapid experimentation and deployment, working effectively with tech and product teams to scale-up and deploy products/product features based on the validated insights


 The Must-Haves:

 Bachelor’s Degree, or higher, in any field of study requiring advanced coursework in data analysis, statistics or empirical research methodology (e.g. economics, psychology, anthropology, sociology or computer science)
 At least 2-3 years of work experience in data science, consulting, applied economics, behavioural science or finance

 Previous experience in experiment design and causal inference
 Previous experience managing a diverse group of stakeholders
 A balance of right-brain and left-brain competencies, spanning a keen appreciation of human behaviour (e.g. deep interests in economics, sociology, anthropology and/or psychology), to data-driven analysis (e.g. randomised control trials, econometric tools)
 An eye for both detail and the bigger picture, including the awareness to know which to focus on at any given time given project requirements


 Our Commitment:
 We are committed to building diverse teams and creating an inclusive workplace that enables all Grabbers to perform at their best, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, gender identity or sexual orientation and other attributes that make each Grabber unique.

Software Engineer (Artificial Intelligence Platforms),Government Technology Agency,Remote in Singapore,"

What the role is



    The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies. Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering. Who we are GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.
  


 What you will be working on



    As a software engineer, you will: • Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities • Design system architectures • Write production quality code, and • Manage deployments to cloud and (occasionally) on-premise infrastructure • Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team. Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to: • Establish best practices • Share your expertise and mentor other engineers • Help with recruiting. You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it. Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value. What it is like working here We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. • Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily. • Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability. • Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good. • Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

Capital Market Big Data Developer,Crédit Agricole CIB,Singapore,"


Description du poste






ABOUT CAPITAL MARKET IT (CMI)
 Capital Markets IT (CMI) is the IT department within the bank focused on solutions related to Capital Markets. This includes Front Office (FO) booking platforms, Risk Management (RM) control and regulatory reporting systems, financial product and contract valuation systems, and much more. It is the department most directly exposed to the bank’s financial operations.
   

 ABOUT MASAI
 MASAI is an ambitious project critical to the Bank’s strategic pivot towards data-centric operations. In the past, separate systems maintained their data separately, modeling the same data in incompatible ways and depending on ad-hoc and sometimes brittle data sharing mechanisms, creating a complex web of interdependent systems and no centralized repository of data. MASAI was initially created to satisfy regulatory requirements set out by the Basel Committee as part of their FRTB capital rules, but quickly became the central focus in the Bank’s push towards a more data-centric approach. It is based on Big Data technology, which allows horizontally-scalable management of data at and beyond the petabyte scale.
   

 ABOUT THE POSITION
 As a member of the MASAI project’s development team, you will develop robust processes to ingest huge amounts of data from disparate systems, and build processes that transform and use that data. The core technology used is Apache Spark on top of HDFS, and development is primarily in Java. The position is ideal for someone with a strong interest in data processing and data science: if you wish to level-up your experience in Big Data technologies and the complex technical ecosystem that surrounds them, this position will put your career firmly on the right track.
   


 An intermediate developer is autonomous, able to understand well-structured code and extend it, and is keen to explore how systems work and is not shy about asking questions to learn more. You will be expected to faithfully and reliably execute tasks assigned to you, respect deadlines, and proactively communicate setbacks and difficulties encountered to the team lead or senior developers.
   

 All candidates, including intermediate developers, will be held to high a standard when it comes to communication, both oral and written. You should have good expository style, be able to explain yourself clearly and concisely, especially when the subject is technical and complex. Fluent English is a non-negotiable requirement. Any knowledge of French would also be an asset.

We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.
  


 What you will be working on



    As a Software Engineer (frontend), you will: • Work closely with product managers, UX designers, data scientists and engineers to define and develop web applications • Use the latest web technologies to translate product specifications into fully functional interfaces • Develop and manage well-functioning APIs • Build and maintain extensible front-end code • Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities • Propose how to structure front end work • Have good eye for technical details in bridging the graphical design and technical feasibility • Be sensitive to the impact of front-end implementation to the users • Write production quality code, and • Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team.
