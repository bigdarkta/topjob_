 We work in a highly collaborative environment and believe in everyone having a voice. We have a strong focus on keeping up-to-date with technology and industry trends through mentoring, regular development seminars, conferences (when the borders allow it), and working alongside customers who encourage us to push the boundaries every day.
 Cyber security is a constantly changing field, and we understand the importance of staying at the top of your game, which is why we offer our team members 20% of their time to focus on training, upskilling, reading, or practicing a relevant interest.
 By the way, did we mention we’re proudly based in the Waikato? Although many of our team live round here too (and love escaping the rat race), flexible working means you can live almost anywhere. When you’re in the office, we have free parking, and a subsidised on-site café.
