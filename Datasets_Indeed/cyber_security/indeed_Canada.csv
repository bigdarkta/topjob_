Summary of the role:
Information security analysts play a key role in protecting our customers from cyberattacks as they are the first to see the security alerts and the first to respond to cybersecurity incidents. Their main role is to filter out the false positive alerts generated by the security controls (through the associated correlation rules), to create a security incident whenever a security alert is detected as true positive and investigate the root cause of that security incident when possible.

This is an ideal environment for those who are passionate for cybersecurity, have a thirst of knowledge and wants to ramp up or advance their cybersecurity skills in a challenging environment. Keeping the bad guys out is what motivates us!
Information security analysts need to be detail oriented because they are responsible for monitoring many aspects simultaneously. They need to watch the protected network and respond to threats and events from a variety of sources. Our information security analysts are working from two offices, one in Canada and one in Switzerland, thus ensuring the full 24x7 coverage.

Review and triage the alerts produced by a diverse set of security controls.

Scan for vulnerabilities on the infrastructure of clients using our vulnerability detection system.
Recommend solutions that would improve the security posture of our customers.
Answer and respond to customer’s calls related to security incidents.
Fine tune the correlation rules with our information security specialists to reduce the amount of false positive alerts on the console.
Support Incident response and malware analysis occurring in customer’s environments.

 Consequence of Error/Judgement
