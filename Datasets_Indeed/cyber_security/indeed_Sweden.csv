Byt karriär och bli Cyber Security –konsult!,Academic Work,Malmö+6 orter,"
Har du funderat på att byta karriär, intresserat dig för cybersäkerhet och vill arbeta som IT-konsult? Eller definierar du dig redan idag som en ”white hat” och har ägnat åtskilliga timmar till CFT-utmaningar, open source projekt och vet hur phishing, malspam och exploits-kits fungerar? Vi välkomnar dig oavsett tidigare förkunskap inom IT eller ej. Vi lovar 12 intensiva och spännande veckors utbildning med belöning om trygg tillsvidareanställning efter avklarad examen. Fortfarande nyfiken? Läs mer om programmet nedan.
Om tjänsten

När chansen dock dök upp var det som att en bit föll på plats som jag inte visste att jag sökte. Både utbildningens fokus på praktiska och direkt användbara kunskaper, men även att den genomförs under en visserligen intensiv men ändå kort period. Det gör att man är tillbaka på banan omgående, jämfört med en mera traditionell utbildning via universitet eller högskola.

 INFORMATION OM UTBILDNINGEN
 Att jobba som IT-konsult och få ett uppdrag inom IT-säkerhet ger en otrolig bredd inom det område du kommer arbeta med. Oavsett vilken uppdragsgivare du börjar jobba hos kommer ditt arbete inkludera områden som strategisk säkerhet, operativ säkerhet och teknisk säkerhet. Då bovarna ständigt hittar nya sätt att försöka få ut information från verksamheter och konsumenter, behöver processer kontinuerligt utvecklas, rutiner effektiviseras och tekniker kontrolleras, för att motverka dem. Detta är alltså en bransch som verkligen innebär att återkommande lära sig nya saker och fortsätta utvecklas i sin yrkesroll. Utbildningen kommer därför innehålla många olika delar för att du ska få en bred grund. Exempelvis Informationssäkerhet, IT-arkitektur, Scripting och nätverkssäkerhet, varierande OS, säkerhetsrisker, monitorering, riskanalyser, penetrationstester och utfallsrapportering.

Förstudieperiod: 17 oktober – 11 november
Utbildningsstart: 14 november
Självstudieuppehåll: v.52 & v.1
Examensdag: 17 februari
Omfattning: Heltid, schemalagd undervisning vardagar kl: 09.00-17.00
Utbildningsort: På Campus i Stockholm, Hagastaden, eller på distans
Arbetsort efter avslutad utbildning: Malmö med omnejd

TRÄFFA DINA STUDIEKAMRATER
 Under utbildningen tillkommer två obligatoriska moment. Oavsett boende- eller arbetsort är du välkommen till vårt Campus i Life City, Hagastaden, Stockholm:

De två sista dagarna i samband med examen, 16 & 17 februari

 Since 2005, Truesec has been a native cybersecurity company, driven by one single purpose: Creating safety and sustainability in a digital world by preventing cyber breach and minimizing impact.
 Over the years, we’ve earned the trust of organizations worldwide and gained a strong reputation internationally. Our team consists of dedicated specialists covering the entire spectrum of cybersecurity – with capabilities in Predict, Prevent, Protect, Respond, and Recover. 
Today, we employ around 200 employees – and as cybercrime grows, we need to grow. To support that goal, we are now looking for an Infrastructure Expert who wants to create advanced security solutions in our Secure Infrastructure domain.

 Over the years, we’ve earned the trust of organizations worldwide and gained a strong reputation internationally. Our team consists of dedicated specialists covering the entire spectrum of cybersecurity – with capabilities in Predict, Prevent, Protect, Respond, and Recover.
 Today, we employ around 200 employees – and as cybercrime grows, we need to grow. To support that goal, we are now looking for a Data Center Specialist who wants to create advanced security solutions in our Secure Infrastructure domain.
 Secure Infrastructure
 Looking at the actual threat landscape today, it’s more important than ever to design and build infrastructure solutions that incorporate correct and relevant security features. The team works closely together using their combined knowledge and experience gathered from different projects and Incident Response cases to help our customers stay ahead of the threat actors.

Performing reviews of customers’ current data center environments to facilitate security enhancement based on our extensive security knowledge.
In some cases, helping our Incident Response Team with the rebuild and recovery of the full virtualization stack (storage, networking, and compute).


 
Your Potential Background 
We believe that you work as a Senior Consultant in the data center area, or that  you are responsible for the data center at a larger organization. You are a team  player who excels at customer dialogue before, during, and after implementation.  You have a healthy understanding of security and can see the need to build secure  infrastructure.

Join Our Mission Toward a Safe Digital Future 
If you truly want to make a difference and make our world a little bit safer, this is the place for you. At Truesec, you'll get to be at the forefront of fighting cybercrime instead of reading about it in the news.

Security Vetting Specialist,Truesec,111 57 Stockholm,"
Do you want to be at the forefront of protecting our society against cyber threats? We are looking for a Security Vetting Specialist to team up with the most dedicated team of specialists in our Human Threat Intelligence (HTI).
 About Truesec – A Leading Cybersecurity Company 
Since 2005, Truesec has been a native cybersecurity company, driven by one single purpose: Creating safety and sustainability in a digital world by preventing cyber breach and minimizing impact.
 Over the years, we’ve earned the trust of organizations worldwide and gained a strong reputation internationally. Our team consists of dedicated specialists covering the entire spectrum of cybersecurity – with capabilities in Predict, Prevent, Protect, Respond, and Recover.
 Today, we employ around 200 employees – and as cybercrime grows, we need to grow. To support that goal, we are now looking for a Security Vetting Specialist who wants to make a difference in our HTI Team.
 Human Threat Intelligence (HTI)
 Our dedicated HTI team works with the human dimension in cybersecurity. Our mission is to identify vulnerabilities among the people that operate our clients’ organizations. The complete protection package of modern business in today’s vulnerable society must include both technological and human factors. To achieve this, the HTI team works by raising awareness, training people, and conducting security vetting.
 
The Role & Your Potential Background
 The HTI team is continuously expanding in order to address our journey ahead. We’re currently searching primarily for vetting interviewers and people who can be a part of complementary analytical services in the years to come. As a security vetting interviewer, you: 

Have the ability and the desire to relate to people wherever they are on their life journey, which means that you probably have considerable life experience yourself and have been actively working for some years. 
Realize that even though we conduct interviews, the actual skill is not in asking the questions but in listening to the answers, especially those not given. 
Are someone who establishes trust in the meeting with people, can drive the conversation in the necessary direction without missing details, and can still create a relaxed atmosphere in the unique setting that an SVI is. 
Understand that behind the sometimes repetitive interviews lies a need to protect Swedish security and that after every SVI, there is a need to analyze consequences and determine if there is a need for action. 

You may come from a different walk of life, and it’s more important to have a personality that fits the mold rather than a specific CV. You may have been working with human relations previously as an HR specialist, a recruiter, in social services, as a police officer, etc. You don’t have to be a security specialist, but you will need to exhibit the analytical and critical thinking that is key to security work.  
Due to the sensitivity in our assignments, we require Swedish citizenship, citizenship in an EU country, or a Swedish work permit. 

Join Our Mission Toward a Safe Digital Future 
If you truly want to make a difference and make our world a little bit safer, this is the place for you. At Truesec, you'll get to be at the forefront of fighting cybercrime instead of reading about it in the news. This is your chance to be part of an exciting journey in a leading cybersecurity company - and learn from some of the best in their field.
 So, are you ready to team up with the most dedicated team of experts and be part of a meaningful mission? Then we are excited to get to know you!

Vill du jobba med cyber security management i utvecklingen av våra militära fordon? Om svaret är ja, så bjuder vi in dig att växa med oss och bidra till att trygga framtiden.
 Din framtida utmaning
 Till avdelningen för produktsäkerhet söker vi nu dig som ska stärka vårt team. Avdelningen består av 14 medarbetare som deltar i olika utvecklings- och supportprojekt med målsättning att skapa säkra produkter.
 Du kommer arbeta som cybersäkerhetsingenjör med fokus på management i våra utvecklingsprojekt av militära fordon. Arbetet innebär att stödja produktutvecklingen inom cybersäkerhet. Du utarbetar kravställning och specifikationer samt övervakar och analyserar fordonens uppfyllande av aktuella krav under dess livscykel. Särskild vikt ligger vid utveckling och support av fordonen.
 I arbetet ingår även att stödja våra kunder med påvisande av kravuppfyllnad som grundar sig i vår kunskap om fordonens säkerhetsarkitektur, dess omgivande system, sårbarhet och säkerhetsfunktioner. Tillsammans med våra kunder och branschen kommer du att utveckla strategier, verktyg och tjänster för att höja vår förmåga att möta ett ökande cyberhot i omvärlden.
 Arbetets tyngdpunkt ligger inom cyber security management, men kräver en teknisk förståelse och ett tekniskt intresse inom området. Du kommer att samarbeta internt med produktutvecklare & produktionsavdelning men även med kunder & användare av produkterna, samt med myndigheter kring frågor som rör cybersäkerhet.
 Området befinner sig i en tillväxtfas där din möjlighet att påverka är mycket stor.
 Tjänsten erbjuder resor, både inom och utanför Sverige.
 Den du är
 Till denna utmanande och viktiga roll söker vi dig som redan idag jobbar med exempelvis kravställning inom cyber security och vill fortsätta utvecklas och ta ännu större ansvar. Eller så har du en mer teknisk roll inom området idag, men vill vidare till att arbeta mer med styrning och kravställning, snarare än att vara ”hands-on” i tekniken.
 Oavsett så har du ett genuint intresse för cybersäkerhet och du får gärna ha erfarenhet av att designa, utveckla och leverera system. Vi ser gärna att du har breda kunskaper inom något av områdena nätverk, arkitektur, programmering, kravställning och/eller granskning. Tidigare erfarenhet av att arbeta i en central roll med många olika intressenter och kravställare ses som fördelaktigt.
 Det är meriterande med erfarenhet av hot-, risk- och sårbarhetsanalyser, kravhantering, hård- och/eller mjukvarudesign ur ett säkerhetsperspektiv, cybersäkerhetsarkitektur och datakommunikation.
 Som person är du självgående och initiativtagande, samtidigt som du har god samarbetsförmåga och tycker om att arbeta i grupp. Att skapa kontakter och underhålla relationer både inom och utanför egna organisationen, kommer naturligt för dig. Du är analytisk, ser logiska samband och har ett gott omdöme. Självklart känner du ett stort ansvar och driver dina arbetsuppgifter med integritet och på ett övertygande sätt. Du behöver också ha god förmåga att planera, organisera och dokumentera ditt arbete både på kort och lång sikt.
 Du har god förmåga att uttrycka dig i tal och skrift på både svenska och teknisk fackengelska.
 Vad du blir en del av
 Hos oss kommer du att ha kul på jobbet och ingen dag kommer att vara den andra lik! Du kommer att få vara med när produkten blir till från idé till dess att den rullar ut till kund. Du kommer att få jobba med framtidens teknik i ett globalt företag där du har stora möjligheter till kompetens & karriärutveckling.
