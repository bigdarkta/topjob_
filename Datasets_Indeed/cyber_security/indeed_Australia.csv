Network Security Specialist,nbn™,Melbourne VIC,"

  Job Expectations
 


   Build your career and Australia’s future.
 

   Not many people can say they are working on building Australia’s future. With us you’ll be doing just that, leaving a legacy for all Australians. Plus, there’s equal employment, great training, and true flexible working arrangements.
 


   Few people can say they are working on securing Australia’s digital future. During the height of the pandemic, it wasn’t rail and road that kept our economy afloat, it was broadband internet that confirmed nbn’s role as one of the most important critical infrastructure assets in Australia. An asset that ran businesses, educated, fed, wifi-enabled telehealth, connected our families, and entertained us.
 


   Our purpose is to lift the digital capability of Australia by building and operating a network that is reliable, fast, resilient, and secure, at the least possible cost to the taxpayer.
 


   In support of this mission and particularly the security pillar, we are on the hunt for a star Network Security Specialist - a fantastic opportunity in the Network Security Risk team, as part of the Network Management function within the Networks, Engineering & Security (NES) business unit.
 


   A bit about your role
 

   As the Network Security Specialist, you are responsible for leading security reviews and risk assessments across the technologies of the Active Network (AN) and the associated Element Management Systems (EMS). Moreover, you will ensure the security control capabilities are applied to meet the security control objectives detailed in the nbn security policies, standards, and guidelines.
 


   The role will see you provide SME support to product delivery projects and security uplift initiatives. This includes producing and reviewing relevant artifacts, and supporting the successful implementation of security capabilities and requirements. Using a risk approach, you will also identify, analyse and communicate any security technical issues, security control gaps and risk exposure including a clear roadmap for remediation.
 


   You will have the opportunity to interact with a broad set of senior stakeholders and to lead process improvement and knowledge sharing initiatives.
 


   A bit about you
 

   The successful candidate will bring experience in telecommunication and/or IT environments with a background and/or passion in security. Particularly, experience in conducting security reviews - identifying and assessing security risks and conducting security requirements assurance and sign-off. Knowledge of relevant telecommunication technology, security standards, and operational frameworks (such as SOCI and TSSR) is ideal. Additionally, experience with risk management and business process improvement would be valuable.
 


   You will bring experience in deploying projects in Telco Networks Engineering and Operations environment and working with a team of technical experts. You are an excellent communicator both written and verbal, collaborative with excellent stakeholder management skills and problem-solving capability.
 


   Ideally the successful candidate will have hands on experience with security toolkits such as Rapid7, Skybox, Splunk, policy management tools as well as Microsoft and McAfee security suites.
 


   Knowledge of advanced security concepts such as cloud and container security will be looked upon favourably.
 


   Knowledge of relevant telecommunication technology, security standards, and operational frameworks (such as SOCI and TSSR) is ideal. Additionally, experience with GRC risk management would be advantageous.
 


   Relevant tertiary degree and/or Security Industry Certification(s) such as CISA, CISM and CISSP is highly regarded, however we are also keen for you to tell us about your passion about securing nbn and learn about your Cyber Security Professional journey.

Why Australia?
 Take 3 minutes to watch the following video and see how you can shape your dreams
  

   There's Nothing Like Australia - (3 minute version) - Bing video
  

Health Care
 The Medicare system in Australia provides access to a wide range of health care services, free medical care in public hospitals and lower costs for prescription medicines. Certain categories of visitors, all Australian citizens and all eligible Australian residents can access these services after enrolling in Medicare.
  

Education
 The Australian public education system has a good reputation for its high quality of students and learning methodologies – it must be noted that academic results are not the only factor that the Australian education system teaches, with equal emphasis on how students interact, learn, do in sports etc. It is a more holistic based system.
  

Weather and Climate
 Australia is also an attractive migration destination because of its temperate weather on most of the East coast. All four season can be found on the Australian east coast region, with the full experience of living through the blue skies of summer and spring as well as the coolness and crispness of winter and autumn.
  

World's most liveable cities
 The Economist runs a survey every year in order to rank the most liveable cities in the world. According to these surveys, multiple Australian cities made it every year on the list of the best cities to live in the world.
  

The Coffee Culture
 Do you love your coffee? If you do, then Australia can be considered a coffee nirvana. Australia is known for its coffee culture – everyone drinks coffee here. There are coffee shops all over the major cities, grinding fresh beans for your coffee fix. Migrants moving from countries with a similar coffee culture have one more reason to like Australia.
  



The Food
 The food is great in Australia, with multiple Michelin star restaurants, fast food chains, cafes and restaurants of every kind. Because of the large migrant population across the country you can enjoy very diverse food options, from authentic Vietnamese to Italian and Chinese food, all being made with freshest ingredients farmed predominantly in Australia.
  



Pathway to citizenship
 All permanent residents can eventually qualify to become an Australian citizen. A big advantage for migrants moving to the country is the fact that Australia recognises dual citizenship and that children born to permanent residents in Australia can apply for citizenship even if their parents don’t yet qualify.
