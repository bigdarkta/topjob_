Cyber Security Analyst,Barclays,"Pune, Maharashtra","
Job Title: Cyber Operations Analyst
Location: Pune


Cybercrime and cyber-attacks against institutions are growing considerably in quality, quantity, and complexity, targeting both private industry and national critical infrastructure. However, a holistic approach across all security disciplines is required to ensure that these are mitigated successfully. Successful attacks against organizations can result in significant disruptions to business transactions, operations, and client activities, as well as regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm and brand tarnishment.


As a global bank, Barclays is at the crosshair of cyber criminals. As an organization that process financial transactions, stores and transmits sensitive client information, and participates in the global financial marketplace, Barclays is an attractive target to organized criminals, hackers and hacktivists. Barclays can expect to see a continued increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks against it, its partners, and its employees and clients. This is made more of a critical issue given the bank’s strategy of providing more and more of its services and products online and via mobile channels.


The developments described above require a different and much more proactive and intelligence led cyber defence, compared to the normal reactive and incident based defences built over the last 20 years. The modern Chief Security Office develops and operates tools that are used by internal groups for protecting information, understanding internal systems and networks in order to prevent attacks, and analysing information to determine whether the organization is under attack. In addition, other tools used in the day to day management of employees or systems may be managed by the Chief Security Office if they are related to its mission of protecting the assets of the company and its customers.

Interprets, analyses and reports all events and anomalies in accordance with cyber security related directives, including initiating, responding and reporting discovered event.
Analysis of Intelligence information to ensure enhanced detection, as well as improvement of functional capability.
Support identification, enhancement, improvement and delivery of monitoring and response methods and processes, to reduce risk to the Organisation.


 
What we’re looking for:

Proficiency in SIEM technologies & usability in a Large & Complex Computing Environment.
Analysis and response of detected security incidents, timely escalation and drive to ensure the closure of incidents.
Incident Response skills including proficiency in PCAP Capture, Network Analysis, and Traffic Patterns.
Identify attacks and malware (Trojans, Ransomware, etc.) analysing event data generated from proxy, endpoints, IDS, MPS, network devices etc.
Proficiency in Phishing Threat Types (Targeted Spear, Broad-based SPAM, Targeted Industry, Whaling, etc.)


 
Skills that will help you in the role:

Proficiency of Operating System fundamentals and OS Security (Windows & Linux);
Proficiency in Networking Principles, Protocols, & Practices;
Understanding of traditional ITIL concepts Incident, Change and Problem management;


Understanding of Cloud Security Principles (AWS/Google/Azure)
Understanding of Open Source network analysis tools, and Open-source intelligence tools (OSINT).


In-depth knowledge of the Cyber Kill-Chain, Intelligence-driven defence and security architectures.
Ability to help write concise reports based on complex data with accuracy, brevity, and speed.
