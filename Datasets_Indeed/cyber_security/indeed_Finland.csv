"Full Stack Developer, Cyber Security",Insta Group Oy,Tampere,"
Haemme Tampereelle tai Espooseen Full Stack Developeria omien kyberturvallisuuden tuotteidemme kehityksen pariin.
 Tuotteitamme ovat kansainvälisille markkinoille suunnattu digitaalisten varmenteiden hallinnointiratkaisu Insta Certifier ja varmenteita ja avaimia hallinnoiva Insta Certificate Lifecycle Manager. CLM-tuotteella voidaan havaita ennalta mahdollisia ongelmia esimerkiksi organisaatioiden TLS-konfiguraatioissa ja automatisoida tarvittavat toimenpiteet. Tuotteisiimme luottavat varmennetuotannossaan mm. viranomaiset sekä finanssi- ja tietoliikennealan suuryritykset. Järjestelmämme varmistavat, että varmenteet päivittyvät aina ajantasaisina ja järjestelmät ovat sitä kautta turvallisempia ja toimintavarmempia. 
Mitä pääset tekemään? 
Pääset kehittämään joko täysin uutta tuotetta tai jalostamaan olemassa olevia pääsääntöisesti Go-kielellä.
 Mikäli sinulta löytyy jo senioriteettia, voit ottaa roolia tiimissä nappaamalla vahvan otteen tuotekehityksen arkkitehtuurista. Työskentelemme Scrum-mallilla, joten pääset mukaan myös tuotteiden suunnittelutyöhön ja vaikuttamaan tehtäviisi. Rooli ja haasteet muokkautuvat juuri sinun näköiseksesi ja erityisosaamisesi otetaan meillä huomioon.
 Tuotteemme ovat käytössä jo useissa yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävissä organisaatioissa, joka tarjoaa varmuutta vuosiksi eteenpäin. Insta on Suomen johtava PKI-asiantuntija (public key infrastructure), joten pääset oppimaan meillä alueesta ja laajemmin tietoturvasta Suomen huippuasiantuntijoilta. 

Mitä toivomme sinulta? 
Sinulla on jo jonkin verran kokemusta full-stack ohjelmoinnista esimerkiksi Javan tai C++:n parista, ja halua ottaa kokemuksesi pohjalta Go-kielen haltuun. Toimit hyvin ja rakentavasti osana tiimiä. Työskentelykielenämme on suomi, mutta myös englannin kielen taito on tehtävässä välttämätöntä kansainvälisen ympäristön vuoksi.
 Eduksi katsomme Go-kielen olella myös aiemman osaamisen Linux-alustasta, mikroarkkitehtuureista ja PKI-kehityksestä.
 
Keitä me olemme? 
Teemme töitä aidosti yhdessä tiimin kesken. Kaikki haluavat kehittyä, katselmoimme toistemme koodia ja kysymme sekä annamme palautetta toisillemme. Innostumme muutenkin uuden oppimisesta ja opitun jakamisesta, ja vaalimme rentoa ilmapiiriä. Avoimessa kulttuurissamme voitkin kysyä mitä vain mistä vain, keneltä tahansa ja saada aina vastauksen. Koronan aikana työskentelemme pääsääntöisesti etänä, mutta päivittäisillä virtuaalikahveilla jutellaan työn lisäksi vapaa-ajan touhuista ja harrastuksista. Jatkossa joustava etätyö on halutessasi mahdollista, mutta näemme mielellämme toisiamme myös toimistolla.
 Suomalaisena perheyhtiönä mottomme ""Lupa luottaa"" konkretisoituu jokapäiväisessä työssämme: toimimme asiakaslähtöisesti ja kannamme yhdessä vastuun tiimin ja jokaisen instalaisen hyvinvoinnista. Maksamme myös osaamistasi vastaavan kilpailukykyisen palkan muine etuineen. Kattavaan etupakettiimme kuuluu esimerkiksi liikunnan ja kulttuurin lisäksi hieronta- ja joukkoliikenne-etu, laaja vapaa-ajan tapaturmavakuutus ja työsuhdepyörä. Tampereella Sarankulmassa voit mm. kuntoilla omalla kuntosalillamme ja ladata henkilökunnan omilla pisteillä niin sähköpyörän kuin autonkin. Sarankulmasta löytyy myös oma työterveyshuollon toimipisteemme. Työn- ja vapaa-ajan yhteensovittaminen sujuu meillä vaivatta joustavien työaikojen ja perhemyönteisen kulttuurin ansiosta.
