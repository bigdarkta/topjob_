In your role as a future “security champion”, you will develop into an expert in IT security in our projects.
Because security is at the forefront: whether fullstack, mobile, DevOps or web. Have our software engineers followed best practices in coding? Can you already identify threats in the architecture?

   Residential real estate is the biggest asset class in the world and the market in Europe is worth an estimated $50 trillion. It’s a huge untapped market, but it’s also completely fragmented!
 

   Homeowners wrestle with huge fees and uncertain processes when they want to sell. Renters struggle to find high-quality homes and often deal with unsympathetic landlords. Financial institutions can’t invest large pools of money into the sector without hiring an army of disparate third parties. And to complicate matters further, building new homes churns out gigatons of carbon, all whilst we face a housing crisis and a global climate emergency.
 


 IMMO is Europe's first technology powered residential real estate platform, designed to create portfolios of existing single family rental (SFR) housing. Our proprietary technology allows us to unlock investment access to 98% of the residential market currently being overlooked, at scale and speed. At the same time, we offer better solutions to consumers – empowering homeowners with quick and transparent sales, and providing a next-gen renting experience for our residents to enjoy living in beautiful homes. With technology in our DNA, data is at the heart of decision making, and we do things sustainably by up-cycling existing properties that are responsibly retrofitted.
 


 We recently raised $75 million in what remains one of Europe’s largest Series B funding rounds. Among our investors are some of the world’s top venture capital firms. IMMO has been awarded “Tech Pioneer” by the World Economic Forum and has been titled “Real estate asset manager of the future” by Goldman Sachs.
