Cyber Security Officer,City of Westminster Council,Westminster,"




About Us:


 THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF 809 CONNECTED BUSINESSES

 Digital and Innovation in Westminster City Council is a world of extraordinary stories, where creative and enterprising people put local residents and businesses first.

 Today, Westminster is the most connected borough in London. But, when David joined us in the mid-2010s, small businesses were still struggling to get connected to fibre. Without gigabit-capable broadband, some companies even resorted to biking memory sticks around the city, simply to share files with clients.

 Although still in a junior role, David took the initiative and successfully made the business case for £2.8 million of European funding to support connectivity for small businesses across Westminster. Feedback from businesses has been overwhelmingly positive as the project has enhanced their communications with clients. The new connectivity allows them to make video calls and work remotely. As the pandemic hit and many more people needed to work from home, it became clear just how vital this investment had been.

 Fast-forward a few years. Westminster is leading the way for connectivity, as a result of the project businesses are thriving and David is heading up a service of his own responsible for delivery of the smart city strategy.




 The Role:


 As Cyber Security Officer, you can make your own powerful contribution to ensuring our status as a leading Digital Local Authority. Working across the whole of the Digital and Innovation portfolio, but specialising in Cyber Security, you’ll be part of major changes in both the digital landscape and the culture of our organisation. 
Regularly monitoring system usage and security, you’ll respond to potential security incidents and recommend effective countermeasures to reduce future risk. You will also respond to enquiries by users and other parties, and carry out administration for a range of critical systems including antivirus and anti-spam management. We’ll expect you to keep up to date with emerging cyber threats. 
Please refer to the Job Description for more information.




 About You:


 With a background in IT, you’re likely to have experience of using network or internet audit and monitoring tools. Knowledge of security issues relating to hardware and software in the Microsoft technology stack is essential. You’ll also be aware of ISO27001 and other information security best practice standards, including cloud security and storage area network security.




 What We Offer:


 Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride.


We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities.


At Westminster City Council, we are passionate about our aim to be an inclusive workplace for all that reflects the communities we serve, and we believe everyone is valued. We particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, including B.A.ME, Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ and those with hidden or visible disabilities. We’re committed to ensuring all our staff – regardless of gender, age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity or disability – can succeed. We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way.

The Bank values diversity and inclusion – we want to reflect the society we serve better; we want the best people to work for us and we want our workplace to be inclusive. We value all forms of diversity, including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion and sexual orientation. One way we support diversity and inclusion is through our staff-run networks, which are summarised here.
We are fully committed to having a diverse and inclusive working environment, and are open to considering how the role might be carried out with flexible working. This role is therefore open to flexible working patterns.
Where a role can be carried out from home, we are working towards colleagues spending at least half of their time in the office, so that we can all benefit from working together in person, while maintaining the flexibility offered by home working. From 5 September 2022, we expect colleagues to spend a minimum of 40% of their working time in the office per month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them and their team. Many staff and contractors in the Security function do not have the option to carry out their role from home so in practice the role holder will need to be on site significantly more than the 40% minimum.
We are also committed to making adjustments for candidates and employees where possible, and have partnered with external expert organisations to support us in this. We are a member of the Disability Confident scheme, summarised here, and people who wish to apply under this scheme should check the box in the ‘Candidate Personal Information’ under the ‘Disability Confident Scheme’ section of the application.

 Who You Are
 You are passionate about cybersecurity and intelligence analysis. You stay abreast of the latest threats, recognize the value of intelligence, and believe it should drive operations. You are a devoted team member who is always willing to lend a hand, mentor a colleague, or increase our global team’s awareness by sharing your knowledge and approaches with others. You are productive, easy to work with, and understand that adherence to a good process is key to excellence.
 Description
 As a Malware Reverse Engineer at ACTI, you will reverse engineer and analyze malware to evaluate sophisticated malicious code to settle malware capabilities and purposes. Analysis includes the use of specialized systems and tools, including dissemblers, debuggers, hex editors, unpackers, virtual machines, and those for network traffic analysis.
 Key Responsibilities

 Analyze malicious events and campaigns to determine attack vectors and retrieve malware payloads. Reverse engineer files suspected or known to belong to identified malware families to determine their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and targeting.
 Incorporate analysis results into detailed reporting to include purpose, behavior, C2 server infrastructure, and mitigation techniques related to analyzed malware families, malicious campaigns, and events.
 Track prevailing malware families, including downloaders, banking Trojans, information stealers, ransomware, and remote access Trojans. Reverse engineer recently discovered malware variants to check potential feature augmentation or configuration structure changes.
 Improve existing tools that extract known malware family configurations based on reverse engineering results.
 Research the latest malware detection evasion techniques, such as use of customized packers, customized crypters, fully undetectable (FUD) techniques, host intrusion prevention system (HIPS) bypassing, and anti-virus (AV) software bypassing. Based on research, design and develop generic unpacking methods and tools for use as standalone tools or within automated analysis systems and sandboxes.
 Provide customer support by responding to requests related to suspicious file analysis that sometimes require malware reverse engineering and determination of contextual information surrounding indicators of compromise; do so by providing detailed analysis reports and mitigation recommendations.
 Provide customer support by responding to cybersecurity requests, including those for: open-source intelligence (OSINT) research; domain, IP address, or URL analysis; malicious campaign information; and/or event attribution. Provide answers to specific questions, the answers of which clients use for operational mentorship to aid their strategies.
 Design, develop, and implement Windows kernel modules to support automated malware analysis; such modules include kernel system service filtering modules able to intercept operating system services on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems without triggering those systems’ self-protection mechanisms, and kernel-mode modules able to force designated processes to load specific modules that load decoders designed for extracting malware configurations.
 Design, develop, and implement generic unpackers that combat widely used malware packing methods to retrieve malicious payloads from packed malware samples automatically.
 Create detection rules and signatures for detecting malware families, and provide detection or blocking recommendations.
 Develop decoders to extract malware configurations—including basic C2 settings or secondary dynamic configurations, such as those outlining targeted institutions and web injects—based on reverse engineering results.
 Provide junior engineers with technical training, including: training on malware analysis; reverse engineering; Windows internals; and development, identification, unpacking, and de-obfuscation of malicious code.
 Travel occasionally as this position may require doing so to address client needs, improve results, or otherwise support projects.

 Basic Qualifications

 Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Forensics, Science, Engineering, Information Systems, or another related security field, or comparable experience.
 Experience with malware analysis, reverse engineering, and development.
 Ability to write, understand, and/or analyze code in programming and scripting languages, including Assembly x86/x64, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP, and HTML.
 Basic knowledge of and experience with malware packers, crypters, and obfuscation techniques.
 Understanding of operating system internals and the Windows API.
 Experience with debuggers, decompilers, and network traffic analysis tools.
 Development experience in Assembly, Python, C, or C++.
 Strong understanding of the intelligence lifecycle and associated analytic methodologies (Cyber Kill Chain, Diamond Model, ATT&CK, etc.).
 Practical understanding of malware analysis and/or reverse engineering, and the ability to develop malware detection signatures (e.g. YARA).

 Work on state-of-the-art Cyber Security equipment within high-grade crypto and information assurance
 Part of an agile organisation, with the ability to make a real difference
 Involved in multiple domains and projects, throughout the engineering lifecycle
 Work in a dynamic environment, with the ability to make significant personal impact
 Have exposure to all functional and business areas, with opportunities to broaden your knowledge
 In an environment where talent is recognised and promoted



   Role Purpose
 


   This isn’t your usual Cyber Engineering role. You’ll be part of a small, highly motivated team of all-rounder engineers, working on some of the most exciting national security challenges in an agile Research and Development setting.
 


   Our research is anything but mundane. We take the “Is that even possible?” ideas and make them work (or prove they don’t). Software, hardware, physics, maths, other disciplines - we use it all. If we don’t know it, we will learn it or go and find someone who does; working with academia and subcontracted companies is part of the role. In addition to doing or directing cutting edge research we get our hands dirty; we build prototypes, we wield spanners, soldering irons and high end test gear. We test things in the real world, alongside end users.
 


   What we are looking for isn’t the ordinary. You may be early career, you may be a time served professional. Maybe you are joining us from one of the services. Individual diversity is valued; we want people from different backgrounds who approach problems from different viewpoints and think a little differently. What matters to us more than your precise background and where you are in your career progression is your passion, your can-do attitude, your competence across a range of technical subjects, your problem solving capabilities and your ability to work with the team.
 


   The role involves close interaction with our customers and subcontractors at all levels of seniority. There is some (mainly UK) travel, with some overnight stays, but you’ll be usually based at our facility in Farnborough. You will need to be capable of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of UK security clearance – so, unfortunately, you’ll have to be a UK national to join us.
 


   Key responsibilities:
 

 Help to explore and understand customer problems, generate requirement specifications and define research tasks to address them
 Develop innovative solutions to technical problems small and large, researching them yourself or pulling in experts from subcontractors as appropriate
 Interact with subcontractors – from technical level collaboration to managing the relationship
 Produce project and technical documents, following appropriate processes, to ensure customer requirements are satisfied
 Plan, co-ordinate and present at internal and external planning, project and design reviews, to senior management and customers
 Actively contribute to and/or lead defined aspects of the project to achieve optimal balance between requirements, schedule and cost



   Personal attributes:
 


   Essential
 

 A bright and inquisitive mind, who wishes to challenge the status quo, and propose new and novel solutions in order to make a difference
 The ability to work with customers to develop great technical solutions to their complex engineering problems
 Capable of developing high quality documentation and engineering artefacts
 Excellent general written and verbal communications skills
 Willing to undergo, and able to achieve and maintain, DV security clearance


   Desirable
 

 Experience in working with multiple engineering and physics disciplines including software, electronic/mechanical hardware, RF, optics, sonics etc.
 Knowledge and interest and/or experience of IP networking
 Knowledge and interest and/or experience of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
 Knowledge and interest and/or experience of industrial mathematics and/or signal processing, including MATLAB
 Knowledge and interest and/or experience of cryptography, cybersecurity and information security
 Wide general knowledge of technical topics and willing to keep up to date on latest research



   Every employee is critical to our success and as such we offer a range of flexible employee benefits including:
 

 Bonus - performance related
 25 days’ holiday with the option to buy an extra 5
 4 x Life Assurance Cover
 Flexible working hours
 Early Finish on a Friday
 Pension Contribution
 Our Ultra Select Benefits package including – subsidised gym & retail, childcare vouchers, cycle to work schemes, etc.



   Our Team
 


   We trust and empower each other; we love to celebrate success and we win as a team. Together, we embrace change and we’re never satisfied until we’ve done what we said we’d do
 


   Here at Ultra we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity and inclusivity. Underpinned by our values, behaviours and policies, we want you to feel empowered to be the best version of yourself. We also believe that people from different backgrounds and cultures will increase our diversity of thinking, ensuring we successfully deliver to our customers.
 


   We therefore do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We also support requests for flexible working arrangements wherever possible.
