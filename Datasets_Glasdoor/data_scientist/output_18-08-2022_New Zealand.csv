Alongside coaching/mentoring peers, you'll lead data science project elements end to end, from solution design, plan phased delivery to translation of end deliverables!

We're super proud of the work we do! With our diverse range of clients and projects, no day will look the same - but here's a snapshot of some of the recent projects keeping our data science team busy:

NLP - sentiment analysis - social media, chatbot data, error correction
Prediction/Forecasting - prediction of economic growth from transaction, prediction of fraud transactions in real time, prediction of customer behaviour
Information extraction - satellite image analysis, facial recognition, image processing

If you're the right Senior Data Scientist for us, you'll have:

an undergraduate degree in maths, statistics, computer science or a postgraduate in broader disciplines such as the sciences.
commercial data science experience across different industries and organisations
strong consulting experience, either with external clients or internally within an organisation
demonstrated ability to coach/mentor peers with less data science or consulting experience
experienced in handling multiple stakeholders and building strong client relationships
enthusiasm and ability to represent the data science domain in internal/external capacity
experience leading data science project elements end to end, from solution design, plan phased delivery to translation of end deliverables
demonstrated ability to deliver outcomes, prioritise steps and manage a team
ability to communicate your recommendations and insights to non-technical audiences to drive decision making
an understanding of key statistical and machine learning concepts across different areas of data science with the ability to manipulate complex data sets to analyse, visualise and prepare data for modelling
extensive experience using at least one open source data science language such as Python or R, fundamental software engineering skills and an understanding of cloud based services and tools

We value diverse skill-sets, and don't necessarily require that you're skilled with all of the above. If you feel you don't fit all the experience/skills listed above we still encourage you to apply or get in touch.

Why join us?

We know you won't have one job for life. That's why we're building a group of companies across Australia and New Zealand where we can support you to take on new skills and challenges. We want to help you develop in your role or diversify your career pathways via alternate brands.
We want each person to tailor their working conditions whether that be remotely every now and then, or on a permanent basis - we know how to actually do 'flexibility' not just talk about it.
You will get to build your experience and fine tune your skills by working on projects right across Mantel Groups portfolio of clients regardless of where you are based.
We're a fast growing progressive company that centres its focus on a people first culture - did we mention we have just ranked #1 in the 2021 Australia's Best Workplaces list!
You will help establish our destination hubs in New Zealand and influence and foster the development of its culture.
We hire smart people and get out of their way. By focusing on our five principles and not getting caught up in red tape, we trust you to get the job done.
Naturally, you'll get all the tools you need - a new iPhone or Google phone, a new Macbook Pro or HP Elite, and a lot of branded swag!

Who are we?

Glad you asked! We are Eliiza. Data science. Engineered for scale.

We are a passionate team of data scientists and engineers who apply data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems. Our mission is to create a bright future for businesses and society in a world increasingly influenced by intelligent technologies.

We don't have a head office, instead have opted for a distributed and diverse leadership team that extends across Australia and New Zealand.

So you're ready for something new?

Along with a diverse range of clients and projects, we guarantee you'll have the opportunity to work with some of the best data scientists, ML engineers and developers in the industry (from across all of Mantel Group).

an adaptable approach and methods based on project and customer needs, are comfortable with ambiguity and can provide guidance on scope and direction
some hands-on technical skills - data science is at the heart of what we do after all! This will allow you to carry out or supervise exploratory data analysis. Experience with SQL and/or BI tools such as PowerBI and Tableau is preferable, and basic understanding of a data science language such as R or Python is a plus!
exposure to ML/AI and cloud technologies is desirable, but an ability to familiarise yourself with new technologies and tools is more important
strong time management skills with ability to prioritise workloads under pressure and meet deadlines
a self-starting attitude, be hands on, and know how to find answers and work with ambiguity
a values driven and practical approach

a genuine passion for and connection to the data science and analytics community

We want each person to tailor their working conditions whether that be remotely every now and then, or on a permanent basis - we know how to actually do 'flexibility' not just talk about it.
You will get to build your experience and fine tune your skills by working on projects right across Mantel Groups portfolio of clients regardless of where you are based.
We're a fast growing progressive company that centres its focus on a people first culture - did we mention we have just ranked #1 in the 2021 Australia's Best Workplaces list!

Science New Zealand,NA,Postdoctoral Fellow in Insect Genomics - Manaaki Whenua,Auckland,"We are seeking an enthusiastic and driven Postdoctoral Fellow to join a research project investigating the genomics of successful asexual reproduction in stick insects.

About the opportunity

Theory predicts that asexual species should rapidly go extinct, yet they are ubiquitous in nature and sometimes long-lived. Previous research looking for signs of 'genomic meltdown' in asexual species has found little evidence of this occurring. We hypothesize that asexual species have used a suite of strategies to adapt their genomes to the challenges of asexual reproduction. Applying comparative genomic methods to New Zealand asexual and sexual stick insects, we hope to reveal what these adaptations are and how they have evolved. Our research will address key questions on the evolution of different reproductive strategies.

This project will include the collection and analysis of genomic data to test our key hypotheses. This will include whole genomes, resequencing, transcriptomic and epigenomic data. The assembly of multiple, high-quality genomes will be an important first step in the project. These genomes will then be used to investigate the activity of transposable elements in sexual and asexual lineages, in conjunction with mRNA and microRNA sequencing. Epigenomic methods will be used to examine regulation of gene expression.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for participating in the design of experiments to achieve the goals of the project. These responsibilities will also include sample management, DNA and RNA extraction and arranging sequencing. Data management and the implementation of bioinformatics pipelines will be important component of the position. The Postdoctoral Fellow will be expected to lead the writing of scientific publications and present findings at conferences. Regular communication and collaboration with the two project Associate Investigators (Julie Blommaert and Palacios-Gimenez) is expected. The project includes funding to travel to Friedrich-Schiller-Universtität, Jena, Germany, to collaborate with Prof Palacios-Gimenez. The successful applicant will also be expected to co-supervise a PhD student, involved in other aspects of the project.

This position is full time (37.5 hours per week) for fixed term for three years and is based at our Auckland site. Project funding is from the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund.

The starting remuneration would be between $80,000 to $90,000 per annum depending on relevant experience.

About you

You will possess a PhD in genomics, molecular biology or bioinformatics, at least some refereed publications, inclusive of lead authorship. Ideally you will be a flexible, pragmatic, self-starter, capable and enthusiastic to manage the collection and analysis of data to achieve project goals.

More details (document) Position Description - Postdoc Fellow Mar 22.pdf We are seeking an enthusiastic and driven Postdoctoral Fellow to join a research project investigating the genomics of successful asexual reproduction in stick insects.

About the opportunity

Theory predicts that asexual species should rapidly go extinct, yet they are ubiquitous in nature and sometimes long-lived. Previous research looking for signs of 'genomic meltdown' in asexual species has found little evidence of this occurring. We hypothesize that asexual species have used a suite of strategies to adapt their genomes to the challenges of asexual reproduction. Applying comparative genomic methods to New Zealand asexual and sexual stick insects, we hope to reveal what these adaptations are and how they have evolved. Our research will address key questions on the evolution of different reproductive strategies.

This project will include the collection and analysis of genomic data to test our key hypotheses. This will include whole genomes, resequencing, transcriptomic and epigenomic data. The assembly of multiple, high-quality genomes will be an important first step in the project. These genomes will then be used to investigate the activity of transposable elements in sexual and asexual lineages, in conjunction with mRNA and microRNA sequencing. Epigenomic methods will be used to examine regulation of gene expression.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for participating in the design of experiments to achieve the goals of the project. These responsibilities will also include sample management, DNA and RNA extraction and arranging sequencing. Data management and the implementation of bioinformatics pipelines will be important component of the position. The Postdoctoral Fellow will be expected to lead the writing of scientific publications and present findings at conferences. Regular communication and collaboration with the two project Associate Investigators (Julie Blommaert and Palacios-Gimenez) is expected. The project includes funding to travel to Friedrich-Schiller-Universtität, Jena, Germany, to collaborate with Prof Palacios-Gimenez. The successful applicant will also be expected to co-supervise a PhD student, involved in other aspects of the project.

This position is full time (37.5 hours per week) for fixed term for three years and is based at our Auckland site. Project funding is from the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund.

The starting remuneration would be between $80,000 to $90,000 per annum depending on relevant experience.

About you

You will possess a PhD in genomics, molecular biology or bioinformatics, at least some refereed publications, inclusive of lead authorship. Ideally you will be a flexible, pragmatic, self-starter, capable and enthusiastic to manage the collection and analysis of data to achieve project goals.

Eliiza,4.6,Senior Consultant - Data Governance,Auckland,"It's official! Eliiza has ranked as No 1 Best Workplace in Australia! (as part of Mantel Groups house of brands - named Best Medium sized workplace 2021!).

Eliiza is jam packed full of passionate data lovers! Our team consists of Data Consultant, Machine Learning Engineers, Data Engineers & Data Scientists all working together to deliver smart data and analytics solutions for our clients.

Our team members are located all around Australia and New Zealand and we dont mind where you are located (within Australia & New Zealand). We've built a hybrid approach to working where you can access any (or all!) of our awesome hubs providing a space for collaboration across Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth & Magnetic island (and more to come including Queenstown & Auckland!) meaning you can choose a work model (and location!) that works best for you and your individual needs!

We don't have a head office, instead have opted for a distributed and diverse leadership team that extends across Australia and New Zealand.

Our approach is simple; we hire smart people and get out of their way. We don't do policies, performance reviews, hierarchies or bureaucracy! By focusing on our five principles and not getting caught up in red tape, we trust you to get the job done.

So you're ready for something new?

The Data and Analytics practice is a brand new team at Eliiza. We will be setting out to help our clients solve a broader set of analytics problems, which will complement both our expertise in ML and AI in Eliiza and our broader Mantel Group solutions.

The Data and Analytics proposition sits across four key areas: Data Strategy, Machine Learning and Data Science Strategy, Data Governance and Data Storytelling. You will be instrumental in supporting the successful delivery of projects, helping build our reputation as one of the most impactful consultancies in the Data and Analytics space.

With our diverse range of clients and projects, no day will look the same - but here's a little snapshot of how you could spend your day:

working to quickly gain understanding of our clients' data environment and culture to assess their data management capabilities and establish where they are at in their data journey
using your strong data management and strategy background, provide recommendations and options in uplifting the clients' data management capabilities
with ease you will interact with both business and technical teams to understand how well-designed data governance framework can add values
working with regulators and internal teams in analysing gaps, proposing solution options and establishing roadmap to close out any audit items
Assist the clients in selecting the right tools and vendors and delivering proof of concepts / values in support of business case and procurement process
Advise clients on the best approach to expand data management capabilities to include privacy & ethics, data security or master data management

If you're the right Senior Consultant - Data Governance for us, you will have:

hands on experience developing and maintaining a data governance framework along with articulating and demonstrating the benefits to both business and technical teams
strong understanding of key data management concepts such as data quality, master data, metadata management & lineage, data architecture, data modelling and privacy & security
developed understanding of these concepts above through hands-on experience (desirable)
good understanding of a modern data platform and its various components such as data lakes, data pipelines / ETL, data warehousing, business intelligence and data science
familiarity with one or more of these data management toolsets: metadata management and lineage, data quality or master data management.
hands on experience developing data strategy in a large organisation or as part of a transformation program (desirable)
consulting experience, either with external clients or internally within an organisation
an analytical mind, keen attention to detail and not afraid to ask ""why?""
self-starter attitude, hands on approach, know how to find answers and can work with ambiguity

Our team is made up of a range of people, with different experience across a huge range of data driven skill sets. We value a diversity of skill-sets, and don't necessarily require that you're skilled with all of the above. If you feel you don't fit all the experience/skills listed we still encourage you to apply or get in touch.

What's on offer/ Why Eliiza?

We make sure you're always one step ahead by investing your learning and development, every year. We build our own training where it doesn't exist yet - it's in our best interest to teach you things you don't already know.
You and your family's health are most important to us. We know everyone is walking their own path in life, so we offer Flexible Leave for those times in your life when you need extra support.
We want each person to tailor their working conditions whether that be remotely every now and then, or on a permanent basis - we know how to actually do 'flexibility' not just talk about it.
You'll be joining a passionate and supportive team who'll move mountains to help you achieve your objective.
You'll get all the tools you need - including the latest phone & laptop along with mobile & data allowance and a lot of swag!

But hold on, you mentioned a house of brands?

We certainly did! Mantel Group is an Australian-owned, 'house of brands' company with eight technology businesses (Eliiza being one of them!) across Australia and New Zealand. We know you won't have one job for life so we're building a group of companies with open borders so we can support you to take on new skills and challenges without leaving an awesome team!

Being part of Mantel Group means it's not just the Eliiza team you'll work with, learn from and see at social events - there's almost 550 of us across DigIO, Kasna, CMD Solutions, Pretzel lab, Azenix, Cuusoo & Itty Bitty Apps!

Sounds like a good match for you?

About Us

We all have our improvement stories to tell. At LIC we believe in constant improvement, never settling and always striving for greatness. We know little improvements can add up to huge gains for our customers, and for our country. We value NZ primary industries and will do whatever it takes to support and grow our farmer community. We're down to earth and we're a diverse bunch - a mix of super smart scientists, veterinarians, farmers, sales people and clever marketing folk. We are inclusive and count ourselves lucky to have people from all backgrounds working with us.

LIC is based in Newstead, Hamilton, where we enjoy more affordable housing, relaxed commuting, easy parking and a readily accessible outdoor lifestyle. Our campus is in a rural setting just outside Hamilton and includes a social club, swimming pool, onsite parking, tennis and volleyball courts and a café with great coffee. We also offer extra leave days per year, family leave for new parents, discounted insurance, employee shares scheme, mental health & well-being program, internal training programmes and an employee assistance programme to name but a few - and we're still working on improvements!

About the Role

This role is part of the Commercial Group and reports to the New Ventures Operations Manager. Our New Ventures department supports two key products - SPACE Pasture Satellites, and the Wagyu Programme.

We are looking for someone to join us in a fixed term role (parental leave cover) to help us deliver the SPACE Satellite Pasture and Cover Evaluation Service as well as providing administrative support to the Wagyu product.

You will have the flexibility to work in our Newstead office or from home if preferred. Part-time hours can be negotiated for the right applicant. Training and ongoing development will be provided.

Your role will be responsible for:

Providing excellent customer service to our farmers, including inbound and outbound calls and email communications.
Administrative support.
The accurate delivery of SPACE pasture reports to farmers
Support of additional New Ventures products when required.

About You

We are seeking a quality-focused individual with exceptional administration and communication skills. To be successful you will need to demonstrate the following:

Excellent phone manner and confident handling of both inbound and outbound calls;
Exceptional attention to detail and high degree of accuracy in all work;
Experience with MS Office with intermediate skills in Excel
A tertiary qualification in agriculture is not essential but will be a distinct advantage.

How to Apply

If you're after a rewarding and social career with people who embrace our company values of Integrity, Innovation, Spirit of Co-Operation, In-tune and Passion, then we would consider ourselves lucky to welcome you on-board.
