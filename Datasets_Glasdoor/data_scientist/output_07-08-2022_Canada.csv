Experimenting, building, and optimizing selected algorithms and related hyper-parameters
Leveraging data mining to uncover interesting patterns or correlation using state-of-the-art methods
Augmenting datasets either algorithmically or using third party sources of information when needed
Enhancing data collection procedures to include information that is relevant for building better engineering and manufacturing automation & optimization systems
Interacting with data engineering specialist to ensure data processing, cleansing, and verifying the integrity of data used for the ML-Ops is reliably done and available during 24/7 operations
Presenting results in a clear manner
Collaborating with 24/7/365 ML-Ops team and ensuring the tracking of ML/AI model performance overtime


You will be successful in this role if you have:
A Bachelor, Master degree or PhD
Excellent understanding of statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning techniques and algorithms, such as k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Forests, RNN, LSTM, DRL, CNN, GAN, etc.

Block,4.1,"Data Scientist, Payment Risk",Toronto,"Company Description
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description
We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Risk Machine Learning & Decision Science team. You'll build processes to root out high-risk activity across the Square platform of products. You will also manage top level Risk KPIs, establish core operational metrics, and make improvements through machine learning solutions or analysis.
The Risk Data Scientist will use analytical skills to identify and prevent the payment risks. You will lead experimentations to promote Risk effectiveness throughout Square. You will partner with product, engineering, operations, policies and sales to influence Squares global Risk road map and processes. You will have a chance to own the key metrics, develop data pipelines, ETL. You will also make direct impact to our key success metrics via building machine learning solutions, risk detection rule development and deployment.
You Will:
Diagnose problems and develop compelling, data-driven recommendations
Develop and maintain multiple data pipelines and ETLs
Partner with Product, Engineering, and operation teams to design solutions to business problems, influence product roadmaps, and solution new products/processes
Have a chance to use machine learning tools to develop data-driven solutions.
Promote creative risk solutions through third-party evaluation and integration with a focus on improving the seller experience
Develop executive presentations for Squares leadership

Qualifications
You have:
A BS/BA in Statistics, Mathematics, Operations Research, Management Science, Computer Science, or a related technical field, OR BS/BA in Criminal Justice, Economics, Business, or a related business field
5+ years of relevant experience (or masters and 3+ years)
Experience with SQL, Python and Looker
Experience driving data-driven solutions and project-managing their implementation
Experience answering unstructured questions and managing projects and tasks to a conclusion
A passion for Square's mission
Experience in risk, trust and safety, payments, or spam prevention

Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is a global technology company with a focus on financial services. Made up of Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD, we build tools to help more people access the economy. Square helps sellers run and grow their businesses with its integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services. With Cash App, anyone can easily send, spend, or invest their money in stocks or Bitcoin. Spiral (formerly Square Crypto) builds and funds free, open-source Bitcoin projects. Artists use TIDAL to help them succeed as entrepreneurs and connect more deeply with fans. TBD is building an open developer platform to make it easier to access Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies without having to go through an institution. Company Description
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Yelp,3.5,Applied Scientist - Inference and Metrics (Remote),Toronto,"Are you intrigued by data? Yelp has hundreds of millions of pieces of user-contributed content, millions of users and business listings, and hundreds of thousands of advertising customers – and all of these numbers are constantly growing. Making sense of this data, deducing relationships between variables, and figuring out different interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. They work in areas including pricing models and auction bidding strategies, learning to rank applications, personalized recommender systems, trust and safety / spam detection, and causal inference.
Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that encourages individual authenticity and “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new team members to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor, and team. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers and scientists, and having fun in a collaborative environment.
Sound exciting? Keep reading.
We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada.
Where You Come In:
Identify and own challenging problems, form testable hypotheses, and drive significant business impact.
Lead the design and analysis of experiments or development of causal and predictive models to test your ideas.
Collaborate with product and engineering to affect changes in production systems and provide intelligence to other teams.
Communicate your conclusions to technical and non-technical audiences alike
Keep the team and our projects current on new developments in ML and statistics by reading papers and attending conferences and local events.
Productionize and automate model pipelines within Python services.
What it Takes to Succeed:
Experience with data analysis/statistical software and packages (pandas/statsmodels/sklearn within Python, R, etc.).
Experience with predictive modeling/machine learning, forecasting, or causal inference.
Ideally a degree in a quantitative discipline such as Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Applied Math, etc., or equivalent experience.
A love for writing beautiful code; you don’t need to be an expert, but experience is a plus and we’ll empower you to learn on the job.
A demonstrated capability for original research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.
Comfortable working in a Unix environment.
Vaccination against COVID-19 is not required for this role. We nonetheless encourage all employees to get vaccinated.

At Yelp, we believe that diversity is an expression of all the unique characteristics that make us human: race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, and education — and those are just a few. We recognize that diverse backgrounds and perspectives strengthen our teams and our product. The foundation of our diversity efforts are closely tied to our core values, which include “Playing Well With Others” and “Authenticity.”
We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and consider qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, medical condition, disability, or any other protected status.
We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities in our job application process. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations-recruiting@yelp.com or 415-969-8488.
Note: Yelp does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to any recruiting alias or employee. Yelp is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes. Are you intrigued by data? Yelp has hundreds of millions of pieces of user-contributed content, millions of users and business listings, and hundreds of thousands of advertising customers – and all of these numbers are constantly growing. Making sense of this data, deducing relationships between variables, and figuring out different interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. They work in areas including pricing models and auction bidding strategies, learning to rank applications, personalized recommender systems, trust and safety / spam detection, and causal inference.
Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that encourages individual authenticity and “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new team members to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor, and team. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers and scientists, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Communicate your conclusions to technical and non-technical audiences alike
Keep the team and our projects current on new developments in ML and statistics by reading papers and attending conferences and local events.
Productionize and automate model pipelines within Python services.
What it Takes to Succeed:
Experience with data analysis/statistical software and packages (pandas/statsmodels/sklearn within Python, R, etc.).
Experience with predictive modeling/machine learning, forecasting, or causal inference.
Ideally a degree in a quantitative discipline such as Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Applied Math, etc., or equivalent experience.
A love for writing beautiful code; you don’t need to be an expert, but experience is a plus and we’ll empower you to learn on the job.
A demonstrated capability for original research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.

Accedian Networks,4.2,Data Scientist,Ottawa,"Data Scientist - Cybersecurity

Who we are

Accedian provides exceptional end-to-end visibility over network performance for millions of services over major Tier-1 and Tier-2 networks globally, allowing our customers to tune and optimize their network to provide the best possible performance and user experience.

What we do

Accedian develops best-in-class network monitoring solutions, based on award-winning hardware and software solutions that are deployed in carrier networks and on enterprises premises. The data we generate is in need of a powerful and scalable platform so that it can be stored, analyzed and presented in ways that are meaningful and intuitive to our customers.

Our new initiative is looking for a few talented designers and developers to work with a small, high-power team of industry experts to launch a Cybersecurity product line. Focused on providing network cybersecurity threat and incident correlation, analytics and visualization we’re using state-of-the-art tools and a modern stack to support advanced use cases.

The current challenge we face is to accumulate, process and eloquently present data streams of network data from various sources, ranging in the hundreds of millions of entries per day. Being able to determine what are useful combinations of data vs false positives is a key objective.

What You Will Do

We want you to be a part of an awesome team as we define the direction and initial product launch. We operate in a “You build it, you run it” mode, where everyone is actively participating in maintaining and improving running software.

We require someone that can analyze the data that we receive, research and propose models for data analysis, and participate in the development of solutions that can be applied to real-time data feed so that real-time insight on the network state can be provided to our customer. We are particularly interested in developing correlation detection and failure prediction analysis, where we can train a model from actual network data to forecast its quality of service over time.

As part of the Skylight Cybersecurity team for Accedian, we are looking for a data scientist that will help us discover information and patterns in large amounts of collected network data.

Your primary focus will be in applying data mining techniques, doing statistical analysis, and building high quality prediction systems integrated with our cybersecurity product. Ideally, you would be able to automate scoring using machine learning techniques and build systems for automated incident detection minimizing false positive incident alerts.

Responsibilities

Creating automated anomaly detection systems and constant tracking of its performance;
Data mining using state-of-the-art methods with various in-cloud data sources;
Working with the product team to extend the company’s data with third party sources of information when needed;
Enhancing data collection procedures to include information that is relevant for building analytic systems;
Processing, cleansing, and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis;
Routinely performing ad-hoc analysis and presenting results in a clear manner.

Your experience should include:

Extensive experience in applying Machine Learning algorithms to detect specific conditions and forecast dataset evolution;
Ability to work in a team where each member has a set of responsibilities, but where you would be the lead data science expert;
Experience in Telecom, mainly around deployments of data networks is a definite asset, but not an absolute requirement;
Industry experience in designing systems that are targeted to be used in production environments;
Experience in working in a fast paced, solution oriented highly functional team a definite asset.

Your Tech Skills would be:

Extensive experience with a combination of R, SAS, Stata or similar tools in the context of Machine Learning algorithms applied to real-world data;
Having a good knowledge and industry experience in a full-stack programming language a definite asset. Professional expertise in Scala, GoLang, Python or similar is strongly desired. Experience in JavaScript an asset;
Being able to develop and deploy software in a dockerized environment, or using Mesos with Spark, or in a Hadoop infrastructure is desirable.

Your Team skill set must include:

Having exceptional interpersonal skills including teamwork, facilitation and negotiation;
Having excellent English written and verbal communication skills;
Showing a strong desire to lead collaboration and open communication amongst teams, and reaching across functional borders to get to a truly awesome solution.

Our integral work includes constructing the pipelines that join provinces with the energy that fuels the nation, and the airports and ports that connect us all. Aecon is there, safely and sustainably building the future.

We lead the infrastructure industry with purpose, and our people are at the heart of everything we do. Our business success relies on strong execution and continuous improvement – driven by the diversity, expertise and teamwork of our employees. We are always searching the globe for exceptional candidates to join the Aecon family and be a part of our forward-thinking, innovative, best-in-class organization!


About the role.
This role will be part of a cross-functional team that is charged with analyzing and identifying root causes that affect profit margin and construction schedules. The data this role will analyze information from Hard Dollar, SAP, and Primavera P6. To be considered for this role, applicants must have demonstratable experience with at least two of the data sources already listed.

The successful candidate has exceptional business acumen and will be a talented analyst in the subjects of classification/decision trees and predictive data modelling using multi-year construction (or other large and complex projects) schedules and related financial (cost, revenue, and margin broken down by cost elements over time) measures.

The successful applicant will be required to participate in the production of monthly reports that establish and build upon a growing body of knowledge related to non-residential construction margin and schedule adherence. Applicants with a proven ability to conduct short cycles of experimental data analysis that provide interpretable and coherent results will have a significant advantage over other applicants.

Key responsibilities are intended to expand Aecon’s emerging data science function by:

Creating a data production line:
Participate in business-operations discussions to identify topics for analysis that centre around achieving planned project margins and construction schedules (i.e. actual versus planned margin, actual versus planned schedule)
Refine the focus of analytical topics into hypotheses that identify causal factors that result in achieving planned results
Determine data needed to test hypotheses and run the related data experiments
Inform data engineers of data requirements including source systems, data items, and features to be engineered
Prioritize engineering needs, test outputs from data engineers, escalate engineering delays
Curate a data analysis zone containing the outputs of the production line
Project manage data production activities

Contributing to a growing knowledge base:
Design an ongoing data research plan that has clear objectives for a rolling 12-month period
Produce a monthly report that summarizes progress against that plan, which will include
Significant findings from the prior month vis-à-vis hypotheses analysis
Planned activities for the coming month
Recommendations that will improve data quality—thereby enhancing future analytic capabilities
Calling out barriers or roadblocks encountered, and recommendations to resolve those roadblocks

Promoting a data culture:
Create and execute a plan to raise awareness of data science across Aecon
Provide technical coaching to colleagues
Contribute to an internal SharePoint site that shares non-confidential data insights with all Aecon employees

Other duties will vary, some additional activities might include:
Perform rapid experiments and studies that are timeboxed and have clear success criteria
In collaboration with the Data Governance lead, create and enforce common data definitions
Champion and ensure the adoption of standards that some stakeholders may find restrictive or burdensome
Conduct bespoke research projects ensuring timelines and objectives are met

Required Knowledge and Experience:
Coaching and mentoring experience
3+ years of experience creating works plans and ensuring delivery of tasks that require the cooperation of stakeholders from different departments and with differing priorities
3+ years of experience influencing and navigating complex (matrixed) stakeholder environments
Master's Degree in a quantitative field, or equivalent experience (5 years) hands-on in a similar role
Experience creating research questions and performing structured quantitative research that results in sufficient evidence to prove or disprove null-hypotheses
Experience drawing conclusions from financial and project schedule data which are able to be successfully defended in detailed discussion with financial and project schedule SMEs
Links to GitHub repositories of original regression and categorical analysis should accompany applications for this role.

Quora,4.5,Data Scientist - Ads Sales (Remote),Vancouver,"[As of June 2020, Quora has become a ""remote-first"" company. This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]

About Quora:

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

About the Team:

Unsurprisingly, then, the Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.

About the Role:

As a data scientist in ads, you'll work closely with sales leadership, product managers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, build visualizations, design randomized controlled experiments, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. In this role, you will deliver data-driven insights to guide our business strategy and extract untapped value in our platform by developing a deep understanding of our advertisers and users. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://quoradata.quora.com/.

Responsibilities:
Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence sales and product strategy and drive roadmap decisions
Analyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities
Design and evaluate A/B tests to make informed recommendations on product changes
Develop metrics and create dashboards to orient the direction of business development and track the success of the business
Communicate insights and recommendations to key partners
Improve the work of other data scientists through mentorship, tool development, and by bringing good industry practices to the team
Minimum Qualifications:
Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here
B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a quantitative field
2+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Proficiency in using SQL and procedural programming languages (e.g. Python, R) to manipulate and analyze data
Familiarity with theoretical foundations of statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression)
Demonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with intuition to translate numbers into insights
Demonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams
Preferred Qualifications:
4+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Experience evangelizing best practices and process improvements on your team
Experience working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (e.g. Presto, Redshift)
Experience pushing code and navigating a complex codebase
Active Quora user with curiosity about the product
