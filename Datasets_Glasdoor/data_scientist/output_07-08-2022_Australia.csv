"Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc.",4.2,Data Scientist,Canberra,"Overview:

Systems Planning and Analysis Australia Pty Ltd (SPA Australia) provides operational analysis and decision support services to the Department of Defence. We draw on a range of data and information sources in order to generate information-rich, user-friendly products that provide insights and recommendations to enhance Defence capability. SPA Australia is growing Australia's sovereign capability through local upskilling of its workforce by drawing on processes and tools used by our parent company SPA US, which has supported the US Department of Defense for the past 49 years. We provide formal and informal training opportunities for our team members.
SPA has a near-term need for a Junior Data Scientist/Analyst to work within a small, highly specialised team to collate, wrangle, transform, analyse and visualise a diverse range of sensitive data in support of specific current and future Navy capabilities.
Responsibilities:

Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At SPA, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works” in order to generate insights and recommendations to improve operational effectiveness and other outcomes.
We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you will fit in well with our multi-disciplined team of analysts.
We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we will spend a lot of time combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modelling happen. This allows the data to be processed, analysed and visualised prior to further analysis being undertaken by domain experts in order to generate actionable insights and recommendations for Navy. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.
Qualifications:

Required Qualifications:
Bachelor’s degree in data science, data analytics, software engineering, or related STEM field.
Experience conducting data analysis and assessments and presenting results. Strong communication skills, both verbal and written.
Strong analytic curiosity, attention to detail, and the desire to learn and apply new skills in support of Navy capabilities
Ability to work well within a team environment alongside technical and operational specialists
Ability to get and maintain a Positive Vetting (PV) Australian Defence security clearance. Applicants must be eligible to obtain and maintain an appropriate Australian security clearance. More information on eligibility for an Australian security clearance can be found at: https://www.defence.gov.au/security/clearances/about/vetting-assessment#eligibility.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and/or Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are applicable to this role and as such, the position will or is likely to require access to material controlled by ITAR and EAR (Controlled Material). Therefore, any person occupying the position must be able to satisfy ITAR and EAR controls, which may require specific authorisation to access Controlled Materials. Accordingly, your citizenship, previous citizenships, race or nationality, or substantive contacts where such contacts are affiliated with proscribed countries under ITAR may be a factor in determining your suitability for this role. Further information on this requirement can be found at: https://spa.com/about/compliance-statements/. If you are concerned about whether you will satisfy the requirements of the role insofar as they relate to ITAR and EAR, you should contact SPA Recruiting at recruiting@spa.com, who will be able to provide you with relevant information.
Desired Qualifications:
Experience with Database software and scripting, such as SQL, VBA
Expertise with at least one coding/scripting language like Python, R, C++, C#
Experience with Geospatial software tools like ArcGIS, or similar Overview:

We embrace diversity and encourage minority candidates to apply.

A typical day will look like this:
Work within a team to deliver end-to-end technical solutions — typically starting with spike sessions, onto architectural design and test creation, iteration on the solution, measuring quality and ultimately deploying to production.
Participation in the design and scoping of greenfield projects, including customer exploration sessions.
Commitment to best practices and a strong culture of peer review.

Qualifications
We are after an exceptional candidate, who has real world experience but is still eager to innovate and learn.

Insurance: understanding of the data needs of insurance risk modelling.
Computer Vision: ML techniques applied to image data.
Tabular Data: generating predictive models from structured and unstructured data including time series analysis.
Working with large data sets, where data sets don’t fit into memory, and require multiple nodes to compute efficiently.
GIS: Knowledge of geospatial tools and techniques at continental scale.
Personal attributes:
Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of theory and best practices are highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: data science is a team sport, communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills.

Innovior Pty. Ltd.,4.0,Data and Analytics Consultant,Sydney,"Do you want to crack complex problems?

Are you after variety across clients, projects and industries?
Look no further. At Innovior, you’ll receive the support you need to excel – and the freedom to make your mark.
Based in Melbourne, Sydney and the Philippines, Innovior is a boutique Digital Transformation Consultancy, working with clients who don’t settle for standard solutions. First we discover, diagnosing concerns, uncovering business process optimisation opportunities and then create actionable strategies. Then we deliver, applying our business experience and technical expertise to deliver deep change. True transformation starts when discovery and delivery are integrated as one.
Our services include Digital transformation, Experience design, Supply chain optimisation and Workforce planning. We are technology agnostic, however, we have deep expertise in UiPath, BluePrism, Microsoft Stack, AWS, Salesforce, ServiceNow and Anaplan.


The Role
In a true consulting, client led and project-based environment, your mandate will be to work collaboratively with stakeholders to understand business problems, articulate objectives and success measures, and translate requirements into current/future state solutions and analytical tools that demonstrate realisable benefits. You will:


Work closely with senior client data owners, data scientists and data engineers to understand their requirements, develop data structures and design, build and deploy frameworks, models and advanced analytical solutions
Participate in all aspects of the solution delivery life cycle including analysis, estimation, design, development, testing, production deployment and support
Development of practices and routines to support data science and automation of analytical based assets into business processes
Ensure data science practices integrate into data architectures and data management principles


About you
With tertiary qualifications in Statistics, Operations Research, Mechanical Engineering, or similar, you will be intrinsically curious and motivated by solving complex business problems and driving outcomes. Stakeholder management and clear idea articulation are keys to consulting success alongside strong project delivery skills.


Your experience to date will include:

A wide range of languages, tools and technologies, including (but not limited to) Azure, AWS, Apache tools, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Python, Scala, Informatica, Splunk
Capabilities such as performance optimisation (data models), production orchestration and automation to improve data engineer productivity
Experience in troubleshooting and solving complex technical problems on large datasets


Our commitment to you
Technology and tools matter. But our people remain our most important asset. Collaboration is at our core and we remain laser-focused on supporting you to succeed. Alongside a hybrid work place, here’s how.
Leave for life - On top of 12 weeks paid parental leave, you’ll receive loyalty leave for every year of service.

Proactive professional development - Excel with learning leave, career roadmaps, tailored development plans and active mentoring.

Feedback for success - Shape your career through our triannual feedback conversations and quarterly satisfaction surveys.

Diversity and inclusion - Workplaces should reflect and embrace the world around us. In fact, it’s one of our cornerstone values.
Want to be part of our exciting story? And help make our next chapter even better than the last?


PS - Culture Amp has shared that research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized groups tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don’t necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please do still get in touch. We’d love to chat and see if we can partner on the next chapter of your career. Do you want to crack complex problems?

Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics

Gain real world experience working on client projects
The opportunity to be fast tracked into our full-time program when you graduate.

Technology has revolutionised the business space and is now more powerful than ever. But with great power comes great responsibility. That’s why we’re here. Part risk, part tech, we help clients protect their intellectual property and data!

Who are we?
Call us biased, but we’re probably the people with the coolest jobs at Deloitte. We help clients navigate tech risks through internal investigations and forensically analysing electronic evidence collected from phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems. Then, we design solutions that help our clients risk-align and future-proof their systems. Pretty cool, right?

What will you get to do?
Known internally as Discovery and Data Management, we help clients navigate tech risks through internal investigations and forensically analysing electronic evidence collected from phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems. Then, we design solutions that help their clients risk-align and future-proof their systems. We’ll be honest, it’s hard to tell you what an average day will look like at Deloitte because every day is just so different! Working on projects with an impressive portfolio of top-tier clients, you’ll get enviable experience as you:

Get exposure to tracing data breaches, intellectual property theft, misuse of computer systems and fraudulent activity (such as corruption and money laundering)
Roll up your sleeves to investigate electronic evidence collected from mobile phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems
Design solutions for engagements relating to electronic discovery, forensic investigations, legal support and digital forensics
Explore and identify patterns in data to underpin decisions and outcomes for clients

Enough about us, let’s talk about you.
We know that as a student, you may not necessarily have a ton of work experience, and that’s okay! At Deloitte, we value your potential to grow more than anything else. We are looking for someone who:

A passion for data analysis, presenting data for visual impact and possesses strong communication and writing skills
Is comfortable with turning ambiguous problems and open-ended tasks into creative solutions
Works best collaboratively – you thrive when working in a team!
Demonstrates a high level of integrity and maintains confidentiality at all times (this is integral considering the nature of work we do!)
Completed or may be completing a degree in data science, software engineering, computing systems, information systems and digital forensics
Desirable for candidates to also have programming (SQL) and coding skills
Australian permanent residency or Australian/New Zealand Citizenship

Why Deloitte?
At Deloitte, we create positively differentiated work experiences that enable our people to feel valued and achieve their full potential. Deloitte Australia opens the door to a career that can cross borders virtually and physically across Asia Pacific to gain experience and access projects beyond Australia’s borders. We value difference, and embrace people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, gender identities, abilities and thinking styles. Knowing that people work best in a variety of ways, we are happy to discuss alternative arrangements if the working pattern you are looking for is not specifically indicated.
We’re committed to continually building a safe and respectful workplace, where all our people feel appreciated and accepted. Through the creation of endorsed employee-led diversity networks which promote cultural, disability, LGBTI+, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and gender equality, we’re leading the way to shape an environment where everybody can thrive.

We are proud to have been recognised for our efforts in inspiring change and accelerating progress – check out our careers site for recent recognition in this space.

Are you in?
If this sounds like the sort of role for you, apply now!

By applying to this job, you will be assessed against the Deloitte Global Talent Standards. We’ve designed these standards to provide our clients with a consistent and exceptional Deloitte employee experience globally.

At Deloitte, we know we’re at our best when we look out for one another; prioritise respect, fairness, development and wellbeing; foster an inclusive culture and embrace diversity in all forms. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment regardless of their background, experience, identity, ability or thinking style, and if you need assistance or an accommodation during the application process for accessibility reasons this is available upon request.

About the opportunity

We are searching for an ML Engineer to help us elevate our core capability in machine learning for natural language. As part of the NLP team, you’ll work with data scientists and other engineers to develop, deploy, and operate models and APIs that power rich text analytics features across Culture Amp’s product suite.

Collaborating with other product teams, the NLP team helps integrate NLP features into all aspects of our products. This will include things like sentiment analysis of survey comments, semantic search and clustering of those comments in survey reports, contextual guidance for managers writing performance reviews, identification of measurable and achievable goals, and more.

Engineering at Culture Amp is an inclusive practice distributed across cross-functional, lightweight Agile teams, which are remote-friendly, and all of which embrace flexible work arrangements. You will be surrounded by talented engineers, learning from others, as well as sharing your knowledge with them as well.

Some of our upcoming work you'll get a chance to get involved in;

Build and deploy models to identify and classify features of performance feedback
Develop APIs to serve real-time inferences from our models
Implement a platform for internal users to label training data

Here’s what we’re looking for:

Python software engineering skills
Experience with various stages of the ML lifecycle: data labeling, training, CI/CD, deployment, versioning, monitoring, etc.
Familiarity with machine learning techniques and frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Some exposure to natural language processing tools (e.g. Spacy, Hugging Face)
Experience working with cloud platforms and infrastructure
Please keep reading!

Research shows that candidates from underrepresented backgrounds often don’t apply for roles unless they meet all the criteria — unlike majority candidates that meet significantly fewer of the requirements.

We strongly encourage you to apply if you’re at all interested: we’d love to learn how you can amplify our team with your unique experience!

We believe that inclusive businesses are better, not only for company performance, but for the world. We have a strong commitment to anti-racism and lead by example. Every step we make as a business towards anti-racism is another step we can take to support our customers in making a better world (of work). View our current commitments to anti-racism.

We ensure you have the tools and support you need to thrive, both inside and outside of work:

A MacBook — for you to do great work where it suits you
Share options — it’s important to us that everyone is an owner and can share in our success
Excellent parental leave and in-work support program — for those starting or growing their family
Flexible working arrangements — wherever we can we aim to make work support the life you want to lead
Fun and inclusive digital and (in the future) in-person events

Eliiza,4.6,Machine Learning Engineer,Melbourne,"As a machine learning engineer, it's your job to merge the worlds of data science and software engineering by building robust and scalable machine learning systems. You will be a full-stack machine learning practitioner, responsible for developing and deploying wonderful machine learning pipelines and applications.

We're looking for people passionate about artificial intelligence and learning new things to solve problems. We're also looking for people who have empathy; we want you to think compassionately, and use your intelligence to build applications which minimise harm and treat people fairly.

Our projects and clients vary a lot - but here's a typical snapshot of some of your responsibilities:

selecting the best technology for a given data science use case, e.g. choosing between a range of different text classification models/services
writing modular, testable code to solve data science problems
applying MLOps principles to data science workflows, e.g. building reproducible feature engineering pipelines
building useful tools to help speed up the data science process, e.g. an interactive labelling service
standing up cloud services to run machine learning workloads, e.g. orchestrating a containerised training pipeline on Kubernetes
choosing the best operational architecture for a machine learning application, e.g. a streaming inference pipeline
Who are we?

Glad you asked! We are Eliiza. Data science. Engineered for scale.

We are a passionate team of data scientists and engineers who apply data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems. Our mission is to create a bright future for Australian and New Zealand businesses and society in a world increasingly influenced by intelligent technologies.

We've built a hybrid approach to remote working where you can access one of our awesome hubs providing a space for collaboration across Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth & Magnetic island (and more to come!) meaning you can choose a work model that works best for you!

We've created a culture that values diversity where people can truly be themselves! We care a lot about growing the Australian AI community in a positive direction, and we're doing several things to try and achieve that:

we provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to work in AI through our associate and intern programmes
we organise and participate in a range of community events, reading groups and meetups
we produce the AI Australia podcast
we blog about topics we care about
we stream brown bag sessions to the broader community

We're also part of Mantel Group's 'house of brands' which means it's not just the Eliiza team you'll work with, learn from and see at social events - there's another 600 of us across DigIO, Kasna, CMD Solutions, Pretzel Lab, Azenix, Cuusoo & Itty Bitty Apps!

So you're ready for something new?

We're keen to know more about you! Our team is made up of a range of people, with different experience across a huge range of data driven skill sets.

If you're the right fit for us, you'll:

have experience and/or strong demonstrated interest in building machine learning applications
understand the importance of CI/CD pipelines and how to set them up
know what a well structured codebase looks like
be experienced with at least one programming language popular in the ML ecosystem
have experience interpreting business problems and translating them into technical solutions
be an open and honest communicator, and have a collaborative approach to solving problems
know your way around a Unix shell
know how to find and evaluate the best tool for a range of different technical challenges
be familiar with cloud tools and services for data science and machine learning

However, we value diverse skill-sets, and don't necessarily require that you're skilled with all of the above. If you feel you don't fit all the experience/skills listed above we still encourage you to apply or get in touch.

What's on offer if you join us?

We make sure you're always one step ahead by investing in and supporting your learning and development, every year. We build our own training where it doesn't exist yet!
We hire smart people and get out of their way. By focusing on our five principles and not getting caught up in red tape, we trust you to get the job done.
You'll get all the tools you need - a new iPhone or Google phone, a new Macbook Pro or Dell, and a lot of branded swag!

But hold on, you mentioned a house of brands?

We certainly did! Mantel Group is an Australian-owned, 'house of brands' company with eight technology businesses (Eliiza being one of them!) across Australia and New Zealand. We're building a group of companies with open borders so we can support you to take on and develop new skills without leaving an awesome team - we know you won't have one job for life!

We may only be just 4 years old but Mantel Group has already been recognised #1 in the 2021 Best Work Places in Australia.

Nearmap,3.7,Machine Learning Engineer,Sydney,"Company Description
Nearmap is unique. An Australian global technology with incredible people; a market-leader with energy and spirit. Nearmap was named as one of the world’s 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2020 by Fast Company magazine – and we’re growing.

At Nearmap, we have tens of petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We produce automated 3D models of entire cities, and have recently launched our new product, Nearmap AI, which turns our visual content into semantic information to power decisions in a wide range of organisations. As a publicly listed company focussed on growth, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field. Nearmap is continually evolving, and you’ll need to thrive in a fast paced environment that changes rapidly.

AI Model Systems, a team within the AI Systems group at Nearmap, is looking for a Machine Learning Engineer preferably with exposure to data systems engineering, join the team and contribute to building our next-generation AI Data Platform.

You’ll be designing, building and operating ML systems that have access to petabytes of imagery and produce labelled datasets used for training of production quality deep learning models. You will work with an incredibly passionate and talented team of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and your work will interface with systems that run on Kubernetes clusters with thousands of GPUs, train large deep learning models with novel architectures, and produce sophisticated data products for a broad range of customers. Working with modern data engineering technologies (e.g. Kafka, Argo Workflow, Snowflake) and using cloud native container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes and Docker along with scientific and GIS libraries to build micro-services and data pipelines will be a core part of the role. We are committed to software best practices including well-tested and analysed code, infrastructure as code, GitOps, CI/CD, and as much automation as makes sense.

We believe an “AI System” is the prism that brings together three ideologies: a) A well-architected software system, b) Clean, reliable and effective datasets, and c) The best of breed deep learning and machine learning techniques.

Job Description
A typical day will look like this:
Work within a team to deliver end-to-end technical solutions - writing high quality Python code, scalable micro-services, data pipelines and workflows.
Talking to all AI team members, understanding the long range problems we are trying to solve and devise novel solutions in collaboration with other teams.
Participation in the design and scoping of greenfield projects.

Qualifications
Skills:
We're after exceptional candidates, who have real-world experience but are eager to learn.

Essential:
Programming/Tech Environments: Ability to code in scientific Python, using a Linux environment, and git for source control.
Software Engineering: Working on shared codebases to produce production-quality code deployed through well-packaged delivery semantics (Conda/PyPI packages and Docker containers).
Big Data Systems: Understanding of the implications of scale, volume, latencies, cost and correctness when dealing with big data, using cloud native platforms and techniques.
Commitment to software engineering principles for scientific Python, a keen eye for clean code, and a passion for robustness and correctness.
Experience with Kubernetes, AWS, Analytical Storage, Event and Queuing technologies, etc. is extremely valuable for this role. Other data engineering and software engineering experience is also desired.
Highly desirable:
Scale: Working with big data and image datasets, where data sets don’t fit into memory and transformations and computation require multiple nodes to compute efficiently.
Micro-services Architecture: A firm grasp of how to build and design modern scalable and containerised services, and how to deconstruct a complex problem into smaller domains that can be independently iterated and scaled.
Domain Knowledge – Handling and working with large scale image, and GIS data.
Scientific Approach: Follow the scientific method of formulating hypotheses, and applying statistical tests to validate them.
MLOps: Experience with operationalising ML applications and workflows.
GP-GPU: Using GPUs to accelerate scientific computing.
Personal attributes:
Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of theory and best practices are highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: Software engineering is a team sport, communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, [click or copy the link] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4janrzqgfxn61l/test.tar.gz?dl=0) and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).
Additional Information
Some of our benefits:
Nearmap takes a holistic approach to our employees’ emotional, physical and financial wellness. Some of our current benefits include competitive pay, access to the Nearmap employee share scheme, short and long-term financial incentives, flexible working options, paid volunteer days, gym and phone rebates, and lots of development opportunities including hack-a-thons and pitch-fests.

Nearmap is unique. An Australian global technology with incredible people; a market-leader with energy and spirit. Nearmap was named as one of the world’s 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2020 by Fast Company magazine – and we’re growing.

At Nearmap, we have tens of petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We produce automated 3D models of entire cities, and have recently launched our new product, Nearmap AI, which turns our visual content into semantic information to power decisions in a wide range of organisations. As a publicly listed company focussed on growth, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field. Nearmap is continually evolving, and you’ll need to thrive in a fast paced environment that changes rapidly.

AI Model Systems, a team within the AI Systems group at Nearmap, is looking for a Machine Learning Engineer preferably with exposure to data systems engineering, join the team and contribute to building our next-generation AI Data Platform.

You’ll be designing, building and operating ML systems that have access to petabytes of imagery and produce labelled datasets used for training of production quality deep learning models. You will work with an incredibly passionate and talented team of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and your work will interface with systems that run on Kubernetes clusters with thousands of GPUs, train large deep learning models with novel architectures, and produce sophisticated data products for a broad range of customers. Working with modern data engineering technologies (e.g. Kafka, Argo Workflow, Snowflake) and using cloud native container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes and Docker along with scientific and GIS libraries to build micro-services and data pipelines will be a core part of the role. We are committed to software best practices including well-tested and analysed code, infrastructure as code, GitOps, CI/CD, and as much automation as makes sense.

We believe an “AI System” is the prism that brings together three ideologies: a) A well-architected software system, b) Clean, reliable and effective datasets, and c) The best of breed deep learning and machine learning techniques.

Job Description
A typical day will look like this:
Work within a team to deliver end-to-end technical solutions - writing high quality Python code, scalable micro-services, data pipelines and workflows.
Talking to all AI team members, understanding the long range problems we are trying to solve and devise novel solutions in collaboration with other teams.
Participation in the design and scoping of greenfield projects.

Qualifications
Skills:
We're after exceptional candidates, who have real-world experience but are eager to learn.

Essential:
Programming/Tech Environments: Ability to code in scientific Python, using a Linux environment, and git for source control.
Software Engineering: Working on shared codebases to produce production-quality code deployed through well-packaged delivery semantics (Conda/PyPI packages and Docker containers).
Big Data Systems: Understanding of the implications of scale, volume, latencies, cost and correctness when dealing with big data, using cloud native platforms and techniques.
Commitment to software engineering principles for scientific Python, a keen eye for clean code, and a passion for robustness and correctness.
Experience with Kubernetes, AWS, Analytical Storage, Event and Queuing technologies, etc. is extremely valuable for this role. Other data engineering and software engineering experience is also desired.
Highly desirable:
Scale: Working with big data and image datasets, where data sets don’t fit into memory and transformations and computation require multiple nodes to compute efficiently.
Micro-services Architecture: A firm grasp of how to build and design modern scalable and containerised services, and how to deconstruct a complex problem into smaller domains that can be independently iterated and scaled.
Domain Knowledge – Handling and working with large scale image, and GIS data.
Scientific Approach: Follow the scientific method of formulating hypotheses, and applying statistical tests to validate them.
MLOps: Experience with operationalising ML applications and workflows.
GP-GPU: Using GPUs to accelerate scientific computing.
Personal attributes:
Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of theory and best practices are highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: Software engineering is a team sport, communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, [click or copy the link] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4janrzqgfxn61l/test.tar.gz?dl=0) and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).
