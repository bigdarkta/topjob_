Indeed,4.4,"Senior Data Scientist, Core Matching (Singapore)",Singapore,"Your Job
The Core Matching team’s mission is to enable matches between jobseekers and jobs, leading to interviews and hires, with the world’s highest-quality job recommendations. To achieve this, we leverage Indeed’s rich data to build machine learning models for our recommendation engines. We work closely with teams in Tokyo, Singapore, Austin, and Seattle. We use various techniques related to information retrieval, ranking, deep learning, and NLP, and our engine powers multiple major Indeed products. Also, we come from diverse backgrounds, spanning many nationalities from all over the world.
We focus on innovating on the way people get jobs and employers hire people. What if employers can locate qualified candidates within a few hours of job posting and start conversations with them? What if jobseekers get to know of the opening of their dream job right after it’s posted on the web and get hired within a few days? We develop recommendation engine using various data with machine learning to show jobseekers matched with jobs while also helping employers find the right candidates quickly.
You're someone who wants to see the impact of your work making a difference every day. You understand how to use data to make decisions and how to train others to do so. You find passion in the craft and are constantly seeking improvement and better ways to solve tough problems. You produce the highest quality machine learning solutions and lead others to do the same. You have delivered challenging technical solutions at scale. You are equally happy talking about deep learning and statistical inference, as you are brainstorming about practical experimental design and technology career development. You love being in the mix technically while providing leadership to your teams.
As a Senior Data Scientist on the team, you will:
Build highly scalable and performant recommendation systems and technologies that can identify best matches between millions of jobs and millions of job seekers in real-time
Experiment with POC ML model improvements, scale them to production, and run iterative AB experiments to improve our matching technology
Represent Indeed at major ML conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR
Break down larger ML initiatives into pieces that deliver incremental business value and execute them

The Core Matching team’s mission is to enable matches between jobseekers and jobs, leading to interviews and hires, with the world’s highest-quality job recommendations. To achieve this, we leverage Indeed’s rich data to build machine learning models for our recommendation engines. We work closely with teams in Tokyo, Singapore, Austin, and Seattle. We use various techniques related to information retrieval, ranking, deep learning, and NLP, and our engine powers multiple major Indeed products. Also, we come from diverse backgrounds, spanning many nationalities from all over the world.
We focus on innovating on the way people get jobs and employers hire people. What if employers can locate qualified candidates within a few hours of job posting and start conversations with them? What if jobseekers get to know of the opening of their dream job right after it’s posted on the web and get hired within a few days? We develop recommendation engine using various data with machine learning to show jobseekers matched with jobs while also helping employers find the right candidates quickly.
You're someone who wants to see the impact of your work making a difference every day. You understand how to use data to make decisions and how to train others to do so. You find passion in the craft and are constantly seeking improvement and better ways to solve tough problems. You produce the highest quality machine learning solutions and lead others to do the same. You have delivered challenging technical solutions at scale. You are equally happy talking about deep learning and statistical inference, as you are brainstorming about practical experimental design and technology career development. You love being in the mix technically while providing leadership to your teams.
As a Senior Data Scientist on the team, you will:
Build highly scalable and performant recommendation systems and technologies that can identify best matches between millions of jobs and millions of job seekers in real-time
Experiment with POC ML model improvements, scale them to production, and run iterative AB experiments to improve our matching technology
Represent Indeed at major ML conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR
Break down larger ML initiatives into pieces that deliver incremental business value and execute them
Who You Are
We are looking for someone who is passionate about designing and building machine learning systems, loves intellectual challenges, is eager to learn, and wants to work with a variety of technologies to “help people get jobs”.

JOB DESCRIPTION
Data Science Intern
Come join Reality Detector (Seer) – a deep-tech startup seed funded by Tim Draper and Draper Associates which is creating AI-powered deception and emotion detection technology to “reveal incongruent words and actions at a glance”. Our purpose is to create a more discerning, trustworthy and prosperous world. Our vision is to augment human understanding through technology and mission is to build a deception indicator and convince skeptics. To achieve this, we are A) Augmenting and commercializing the detection of deceptive and physiological cues (indicative of emotive and cognitive processes) with multi-spectral computer vision; B) Automating and developing the complex coordination and integration of other sensors and AI features (Audio, NLP, Semantics) for a machine learning deception algorithm. Our initial product market fit is in creating cutting-edge biometrics to enhance travel across borders and protect innocents from harmful lies. The Data science intern will be working in a small team including data scientists, psychologists and software developers to develop the subsequent versions of our computer vision software, including audio and NLP features.
CultureContributing to a catalytic and innovative start-up as a founding member is an opportunity to maximize authenticity, autonomy and alignment.Through novel technology, growth mindsets and hybrid structures we can co-create the most enlightening and enriching work experiences possible.We are what we do – internally image management and eye-service are neither necessary nor desired.We shall not bear false witness of each other and we try to keep our word, even to our own hurt.Team members help each other achieve our individual and collective best and learn as much as possible.
