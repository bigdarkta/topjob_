Quora,4.5,Data Scientist - Ads Sales (Remote),Dublin,"[As of June 2020, Quora has become a ""remote-first"" company. This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]

About Quora:

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

About the Team:

Unsurprisingly, then, the Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.

About the Role:

As a data scientist in ads, you'll work closely with sales leadership, product managers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, build visualizations, design randomized controlled experiments, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. In this role, you will deliver data-driven insights to guide our business strategy and extract untapped value in our platform by developing a deep understanding of our advertisers and users. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://quoradata.quora.com/.

Responsibilities:
Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence sales and product strategy and drive roadmap decisions
Analyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities
Design and evaluate A/B tests to make informed recommendations on product changes
Develop metrics and create dashboards to orient the direction of business development and track the success of the business
Communicate insights and recommendations to key partners
Improve the work of other data scientists through mentorship, tool development, and by bringing good industry practices to the team
Minimum Qualifications:
Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here
B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a quantitative field
2+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Proficiency in using SQL and procedural programming languages (e.g. Python, R) to manipulate and analyze data
Familiarity with theoretical foundations of statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression)
Demonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with intuition to translate numbers into insights
Demonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams
Preferred Qualifications:
4+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Experience evangelizing best practices and process improvements on your team
Experience working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (e.g. Presto, Redshift)
Experience pushing code and navigating a complex codebase
Active Quora user with curiosity about the product


We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Amazon’s mission is to be the most customer centric company in the world. The Workforce Staffing organization is on the front line of that mission by hiring the hourly fulfilment associates who make that mission a reality. To drive the necessary growth and continued scale of Amazon’s associate needs within a constrained employment environment, Amazon is creating a Workforce Staffing research program.
This program will re-invent how Amazon attracts, communicates with, and ultimately hires its hourly associates. This team will own multi-layered research and program implementation to drive deep learnings, process improvements, and strategic recommendations to global leadership. Are you passionate about data? Are you a tinkerer by trade? Do you enjoy questioning the status quo? Do complex and difficult challenges excite you? If yes, this may be the team for you.
As a Manager, Data Science in Workforce Staffing, you will have a strong focus on quantitative data analysis, understanding labor markets and the candidates within them. You will be responsible for building and developing a team, developing roadmaps, and driving business impact through your research at global scale.
You will lead data science projects using your deep expertise in statistics (regressions, multilevel models, structural equation models, etc.), and data collection in a variety of settings (e.g., field studies, surveys, existing large data sets) to define and answer nebulous problems. You leverage your quantitative background to develop and test theoretical frameworks and design experiments. You design, deployment, and conduct analysis of our global candidate research activities, using experimental, quasi-experimental, and RCT methods. You relentlessly obsess over understanding our candidates and what attracts them to Amazon. You work with colleagues across Research, Data Science, Business Intelligence and related teams to enable Amazon find and hire the right candidates for the right roles at an unprecedented scale.

Tyndall National Institute,4.2,Masters in Intelligent Visualisation using Machine Learning,Cork,"PCM-12 Masters in Intelligent Visualisation using Machine Learning for Magnetic Tracking in Image-guided Surgery
Contract: Full-time/Fixed Term
Tyndall National Institute is a leading European research centre in integrated ICT (Information and Communications Technology) hardware and systems. Specialising in both electronics and photonics – materials, devices, circuits and systems – we are globally leading in our core research areas of bio-photonics, bioelectronics, biomedical devices and systems. As the national institute for photonics and micro/nanoelectronics and a research flagship of UCC, the institute employs 600 researchers, engineers and support staff, including 120 full-time graduate students. Tyndall is the lead institute for the Irish Photonics Integration Centre (IPIC) and European Space Agency (ESA) Space Solutions Centre Ireland and hosts industry-aligned research centres; Microelectronic Circuits Centre Ireland (MCCI); International Energy Research Centre (IERC); and the Centre for Future Networks and Communications (CONNECT).
Reporting to Prof. Padraig Cantillon-Murphy, this position involves the development of new algorithms including machine learning approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position within magnetic tracking. The student will be based at the Tyndall National Institute with a student’s appointment in the School of Engineering, University College Cork.
Magnetic Tracking is a technology which enables the use of navigated instruments in image-guided interventions such as surgery without the use of x-rays. Magnetic tracking involves the use of frequency-modulated magnetic fields in the volume of interest. These fields are detected by tiny sensors (currently under development at MCCI) embedded within surgical tools and instruments. This approach works well in the absence of metal distortion of the magnetic field from other large medical equipment such as CT imaging machines.
The aim of this project is to develop new algorithms which provide intelligent visualisation of the tracked tool position. To date, the algorithm to determine the tracked tool position is determined by a non-linear least-squares regression approach without any additional input. This project will combine a priori tool position, supplementary sensor inputs and possibly machine learning approaches to determine an ‘intelligent’ tool position. This work will take place in Python but Matlab and C may also be used, particularly for edge-based computing. Finally, the project will look to provide a visualisation of the tool position in the virtual 3D Slicer environment. 3D Slicer is an open-source visualisation platform for image-guided surgery (https://www.slicer.org/) which is in C and Python.
Responsibilities
The candidate is expected to be creative, self-motivated, and should help create an efficiently and friendly atmosphere within the research team at UCC and Tyndall.
Propose innovative approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position in magnetic tracking.
With guidance, implement visualisation of the optimised tool position in the 3D Slicer environment. This involves Python-based implementation using real and simulated tracking data, as well as interfacing with the system-level hardware already available in the research group.
Engage in the dissemination of the results of the research, as directed by and with the support of senior Tyndall and UCC research staff.

Essential Criteria:
The minimum academic qualification is a first or upper second class honours degree (or an equivalent international degree) in electrical engineering, industrial physics, electronic engineering, physics or related relevant discipline.
The successful candidate will be highly analytical with good interpersonal and organisational skills.

Desirable Criteria
Knowledge of Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and LaTeX.
Good mathematical ability and knowledge of signal processing.
Knowledge of interface between hardware and software systems.
The successful candidate will be highly innovative with a strong desire to create world-beating solutions in the area of magnetic tracking for image-guided surgery.

An annual student stipend of €18,500 applies for this successful candidate for this position. Yearly University academic fees will paid by the Tyndall National Institute.

About Quora:

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

About the Team:

Our small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas. Using continuous deployment, we quickly see our changes in the product and make fast iterations. Our engineers focus on creating polished products and writing high-quality code by designing APIs and abstractions that are extensible and maintainable.

We are looking for an experienced Machine Learning engineer to join our Machine Learning team responsible for Ads ranking, targeting, as well as other monetization strategies. As an engineer on the team, you will have a unique opportunity to have a high impact by advancing these ML models and systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply machine learning to the Quora monetization products.

Responsibilities:
Improve our existing machine learning systems using your core coding skills and ML knowledge
Identify new opportunities to apply machine learning to different parts of the Quora product
Work with other machine learning engineers to implement algorithms and systems in an efficient way

Minimum Qualifications:
Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here
3+ years of professional software development experience in machine learning
1+ years of professional experience working on machine learning backed monetization. This can include advertising, subscriptions, etc

REMOTE STRATEGY:

Algolia’s workplace strategy, Hybrid Remote, is designed to harness the power of the opportunities that remote work offers both employees and the company, while also providing an engaging in-office experience for the times when an employee is in an office. Our workplace approach reflects the belief that an employee’s impact, contribution, and output are more important than their physical location.

The majority of employees will be able to choose if, and when, they come into an office on a regular basis. There will be times when our people are asked to come into an office for “moments that matter:” activities like critical planning meetings and team social gatherings. Beyond those events, 80% of our workforce may choose the location from where they work in the country in which they were hired.

We have physical offices in San Francisco, NYC, Atlanta, Paris, London, Austin, and Bucharest. https://www.algolia.com/about/

ABOUT US:

We not I
Take daily responsibility to make the Global Arm community thrive

Realise that we win when we collaborate — and that everyone misses out when we don’t
Passion for progress
Our differences are our strength. Widen and mix up the pool of people you connect with
Difficult things can take unexpected directions. Stick with it
Make feedback positive and expansive, not negative and narrow
The essence of progress is that it can’t stop. Grow with it and be responsible for your own progress
Be your brilliant self
Be quirky not egocentric
Recognise the power in saying ‘I don’t know’
Make trust our default position
Hold strong opinions lightly
With offices around the world, Arm is full of diverse, dedicated, creative and hard-working engineers. By enabling an inclusive, meritocratic and open workplace where all our people can grow and succeed, we support our people to share their contributions to Arm's success in the global marketplace.

We not I
Take daily responsibility to make the Global Arm community thrive
No individual has the right answer. Brilliance is collective

Realise that we win when we collaborate — and that everyone misses out when we don’t
Passion for progress
Our differences are our strength. Widen and mix up the pool of people you connect with
Difficult things can take unexpected directions. Stick with it
Make feedback positive and expansive, not negative and narrow
The essence of progress is that it can’t stop. Grow with it and be responsible for your own progress
Be your brilliant self
Be quirky not egocentric
Recognise the power in saying ‘I don’t know’
Make trust our default position
Hold strong opinions lightly

About Quora:

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

About the Team:

Our small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas. Using continuous deployment, we quickly see our changes in the product and make fast iterations. Our engineers focus on creating polished products and writing high quality code by designing APIs and abstractions that are extensible and maintainable. As a remote first company, our engineers have a high degree of flexibility and autonomy. Everyone on the engineering team has a huge impact on our product and our company.

As a recommendation systems expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing our ranking systems as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply machine learning to the Quora product. You will also play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

Responsibilities:
Improve our existing machine learning systems using your core coding skills and ML knowledge
Identify new opportunities to apply machine learning to different parts of the Quora product
Work with other machine learning engineers to implement algorithms and systems in an efficient way
Take end to end ownership of machine learning systems - data pipelines, candidate extraction, feature engineering, model training, as well as integration into our production systems
Minimum Qualifications:
Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here
3+ years of professional software development experience in machine learning
1+ years of professional experience working on recommendation systems
Good understanding of mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms
Previous experience building end to end machine learning systems
BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering or a related technical field
