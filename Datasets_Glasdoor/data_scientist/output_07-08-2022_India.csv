Pre-Covid, factions of our team would enjoy catching up over a round of drinks after work. However, with WFH becoming more normalized, we've been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home. This includes ample “fun” Zoom calls where we discuss latest and interesting tech-related findings.

About the Role
They say no man is an island - a notion that holds particularly true for this role. As a Data Scientist, you’ll be an instrumental cog in the Marketplace wheel of Gojek that directly impacts GoFood's revenue and user experience. Your main objective will be to utilize various quantitative techniques, such as Machine Learning, Optimization, Simulation, and Bayesian Techniques, to drive asymmetric values for our business at Gojek. The folks over at the Data Science Platform team will be your companions during this ride, as they help to bring your models to production. Best yet, you’ll have the opportunity to flex and hone in on your skills in ideation, research, and building prototypes!

What You Will Do
Own the end-to-end lifecycle of data science models - right from scoping the problem statement, through data collection, model building, model deployment to monitoring performance of the model in production and creating a roadmap for future enhancements.
Work closely with Product managers and Business stakeholders to understand their day-to-day problems, analyse the impact data-driven decisions can bring, and propose data solutions.
Take ownership of the business outcomes/metrics that the data science solution can bring.
Focus majorly on how to better leverage our content to enable better customer engagement on the platform and grow the volume of mature GoFood users
What You Will Need
3+ years of experience in building machine learning models for product applications with a strong business sense and data-driven role background
Ability to understand business concerns and formulate them as technical problems that can be solved using data and maths/stats/ML
Familiarity with essential data science libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn
Experience building scalable ML solutions and familiarity with best practices in deployment
Experience working with cross-functional teams including product, design, engineering, mobile to deliver product outcomes using data science
About the Team
Our GoFood Data squad currently consists of around 25 people from various technical backgrounds and based in India and Indonesia, who together help set Southeast Asia’s leading GoFood for greater success. We oversee all things data and work to become a thought partner for our Business Users, Product Team, and Decision Makers. It’s our job to aid their brainstorming in identifying new product or business opportunities, work with them in defining the problem statement and ensure that they have a structural approach to data-driven problem-solving. Right now, there is only one question we try to solve in our three-way marketplace: how to make customers, drivers, and merchants happy and delighted. We have so far created millions of dollar impact across different journeys of customers - Improving discovery and redemption of promotions, providing tailor-made promotions for different customers, improving discovery of merchants, aiding merchants in creating better content on their profiles etc.
We work with the product managers hand-in-glove - be it constructing a new machine learning solution or brainstorming on a problem like how do we identify profitable user base, how do we improve the assortment of GoFood merchants, should we treat convenience seeking customer differently from value seeking customer etc
As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. We’re a closely knit group of people from diverse backgrounds, who have regular chill sessions where we play games, or talk about everything and anything from making coffee to our current movie list. With WFH becoming more normalised, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favourite ways to prioritise a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone?  )

Focus majorly on how to better leverage our content to enable better customer engagement on the platform and grow the volume of mature GoFood users

3+ years of experience in building machine learning models for product applications with a strong business sense and data-driven role background
Ability to understand business concerns and formulate them as technical problems that can be solved using data and maths/stats/ML
Familiarity with essential data science libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn

About the Team
Our GoFood Data squad currently consists of around 25 people from various technical backgrounds and based in India and Indonesia, who together help set Southeast Asia’s leading GoFood for greater success. We oversee all things data and work to become a thought partner for our Business Users, Product Team, and Decision Makers. It’s our job to aid their brainstorming in identifying new product or business opportunities, work with them in defining the problem statement and ensure that they have a structural approach to data-driven problem-solving. Right now, there is only one question we try to solve in our three-way marketplace: how to make customers, drivers, and merchants happy and delighted. We have so far created millions of dollar impact across different journeys of customers - Improving discovery and redemption of promotions, providing tailor-made promotions for different customers, improving discovery of merchants, aiding merchants in creating better content on their profiles etc.
We work with the product managers hand-in-glove - be it constructing a new machine learning solution or brainstorming on a problem like how do we identify profitable user base, how do we improve the assortment of GoFood merchants, should we treat convenience seeking customer differently from value seeking customer etc
As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. We’re a closely knit group of people from diverse backgrounds, who have regular chill sessions where we play games, or talk about everything and anything from making coffee to our current movie list. With WFH becoming more normalised, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favourite ways to prioritise a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone?  )

Job brief
At the FSS Data Platform & Intelligence team we are looking for experienced Data Scientist who will help us re-invent the way we create transparent, industry leading payment products. A role with this team means building scalable data science products in support of the ever-changing financial services landscape. You will have exposure to large datasets, wide & mixed data , feature engineering and transformation, statistical & AI model development. In this role, you will contribute to the design, development and deployment of analytic models. We are looking for creative problem-solver who discovers hidden patterns in the data and trends by experimenting with various machine learning techniques and find innovative solutions to our customer’s problems.
Who we are?
Payments and settlements are the backbone of any economy, and India has been rapidly leapfrogging from a country where cash is king to a new digitally native India that prefers to transact digitally. However, the legacy infrastructure that powers banks today is struggling to keep pace. With design-heavy architectures, disconnected interfaces, and clunky integrations, these systems are unable to economically scale-up in the face of rising demand for financial services from India’s unbanked masses.
FSS is on a mission to democratize access to financial services for 1.3 billion Bharatvasis by decoupling financial services from the legacy systems that restrict their distribution. Just like Amazon solves for the distribution of physical goods, FSS is creating the underlying digital infrastructure that will solve for the distribution of all digitally manufactured and consumed products. Having successfully led the digitization of banking in India over the past three decades, we are uniquely poised to create this game-changing digital platform. Our platform will not only be the launchpad for scores of indigenous experiments that will become the unicorns of tomorrow but will also spark-off a disruption across digital transactions, starting with financial services.
A day in the role will look like:
Collaborate with domain experts, formulate questions, gather, process and analyze bigdata to unearth reliable insights
Design & execute experiments and analyze experimental results
Ability to develop and deploy scalable and reproducible data science models for answering variety of business problems
Partner with data engineering teams to improve quality of data assets, metrics and insights
Communicate insights effectively to audience of a wide range of backgrounds
Leverage industry best practices to establish repeatable science practices, principles & processes like DevOps, MLOps, CI-CD
You will be a great fit if
Strong knowledge in Python, SQL and Spark.
Good working Knowledge of Mathematical and statistical concepts
Should have experience in developing and deploying Machine learning & Deep learning models
Must have good knowledge on Datawarehouse concepts and data modelling
Ability to creatively solve business problems, experiment with new approaches as and where required
Experience in working with agile teams
Experience in BFSI (Banking and Financial services background) is desirable

Our GoMart squad currently consists of around 20 people based in India and Indonesia. We oversee all things data and work to become a thought partner for our Business Users, Product Team, and Decision Makers. It’s our job to ensure that they have a structural approach to data-driven problem-solving. Right now, there is only one question we try to solve in our three-way marketplace: how to give customers the best and most delightful shopping experience in GoMart.
We work with the PMs hand-in-glove - be it constructing a new machine learning solution or brainstorming on a problem like how do we reduce the search time for a customer, how do we improve assortment of our recommended SKUs, should we treat convenience seeking customer differently from value seeking customer etc.
As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. Along with us coming from diverse backgrounds, we often have fun sessions to talk about everything and anything from data information to our current movie list. With WFH becoming more normalized, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone?  ).
