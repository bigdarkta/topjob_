Murmuration,5.0,Data Scientist,"New York, NY","About Murmuration/What We Do
Murmuration is a political strategy organization that is transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.
We empower campaigns, advocates, and organizers to better engage and mobilize communities to demand improvements to the public education system. We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data, and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.
Who We Are
Our team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives, political campaign veterans, and more - and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.
Background
Murmuration’s role is to support organizations and communities through our political systems, to raise the profile of the issue of public education such that more Americans will prioritize the needs of our students, and to leverage politics to help to create the broader context in which those on the front lines with our children can thrive. We are focused on transforming the politics of education—partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders—electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters—contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.
About the Position


We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Data Scientist to join our team. You are flexible and eager to contribute to a highly collaborative team. You will be working hand-in-hand with the Partnerships team and all of our Data Scientists to develop highly optimized predictive models from a large volume of regularly updated data and to design experiments to test the effectiveness of various campaign tactics. In addition, you will be a key resource for building out custom analytics to help analyze our partners’ work in the political organizing and advocacy spheres. You will be working in a small but dedicated, detail-oriented team that is committed to our mission. The Murmuration work environment is friendly, impact-driven, and highly collaborative.


Note: At Murmuration, we are committed to becoming an even more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. To this end, all staff members are expected to sit on and actively participate in DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) subcommittees. These subcommittees work to ensure that DEI is embedded in everything we do.
Key Responsibilities

Provide analytic insights and deliver data science products for our partners throughout the lifecycle of their campaign(s) by building and recommending custom models, providing analysis of campaign work, and producing post-campaign analytics to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts;

Create predictive models using the latest machine learning algorithms on relatively “big” data;
Explore data sets for insights that can help drive product improvements and feature prioritization;
Contribute to the expansion and refinement of Murmuration proprietary codebase;
Design and implement large-scale randomized controlled trials to gauge the general effectiveness of advocacy and campaign efforts;
Learn to work collaboratively in a technical environment with the goal of building tools that are constantly evolving based on our needs; and
Work closely with our partnerships team to identify and develop practical ways to apply our leading analytics to our partners’ problems.


Who You Are

Experience with scripting and general purpose programming languages (SQL, Python, or R);
Experience data mining large datasets (familiarity with voterfile or Census data is a plus);
Experience building and deploying machine learning models;
Strong understanding of basic statistical techniques and how to apply them to a variety of real-world datasets;
Strong problem-solving skills as well as the ability to effectively communicate findings and recommendations to non-technical audiences; and

We help our clients optimize their engagements with individual customers, supporters, and stakeholders to achieve their goals. Simply put: we help our partners do the most good by getting the most from their data.
Today, our team of data analysts, scientists, engineers, and strategists come together from diverse backgrounds to share a passion for using data to solve the world’s greatest social and analytical challenges. We’ve served more than 400 organizations ranging from government agencies, advocacy groups, unions, political campaigns, international groups, and companies.

About the Team:

The BlueLabs Data Science Team develops deep expertise and uses data to inform strategic advice to our clients. Our polling work designs, implements, and fields tools that power our analysis and messaging. We take a deep dive into research that looks at what motivates people to vote, buy a product, hold an opinion, and whether campaigns are successful. Our statistical research identifies areas where we can better assess the impact of various factors in the campaign and polling areas. Our fast-paced, impact-driven team conducts innovative analysis to support our clients’ work. We bring definition to challenging problems, creatively identify data sources, then design analytics that accurately measure impact and move the needle every day. We work in changing, ambiguous environments, so we embrace nuance, inclusivity, and complexity to deliver programs that work for the diverse groups of individuals who rely on us.
About the Role:

Data Scientists use a combination of statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to solve problems, ranging from customized solutions for specific clients to creating the methodological backbone for our general purpose products. They have strong technical skills and are also creative thinkers who are always looking to innovate and deliver value to our clients. They aren’t afraid of messy data, and are comfortable working in a fast paced, production-oriented environment. Our team members receive strong mentorship and are given a chance to complete projects independently.
What You’ll Do:

Analyze data, as well as contribute to the design, implementation, and delivery of analytics products and services

Strive to support team excellence by documenting processes and evangelizing new approaches
Work both independently and as part of a team to deliver accurate products on short deadlines


Who You Are:

You can apply variety of skills: whether thinking strategically about how to develop an enduring process, digging deep into a complex data analysis, or putting yourself in the shoes of an end-user to answer a question they didn’t know they had - you’re comfortable thinking from a number of different perspectives
You are able to respond to questions from your stakeholders while remaining objective in how you approach their unique challenges. You are able to derive value from imperfect data, but also have the ability to know when to push the emergency stop button.


What We Are Seeking:

Experience working in a quantitative production environment or a postgraduate degree in a quantitative field
Experience in and ability to apply your knowledge of foundations of statistics and modeling (distributions, parameter estimation, confidence intervals and tests, etc.)
Advanced understanding of a statistical programming language such as R, Python, or Julia
Experience building predictive models using regression and machine learning techniques
Ability to manipulate data with SQL
Experience creating analytics output within a production-oriented team
Ability to effectively communicate technical concepts to a non-technical audience, both in writing and verbally
Knowledge of experimental design and causal inference
Experience creating informative and engaging data visualizations using industry leading tools

And SMBC is committed to disrupting the US marketplace with ground-breaking products.
It’s the best of both worlds, and we are seeking proven marketing leaders to propel us towards a national launch. We have both the ambitious growth plans and the “patient capital” necessary to execute a multi-year plan. Join us on the journey to deliver an exciting concept of evolved banking.

Establish strong partnership with product stakeholders in identifying opportunities, prioritize roadmaps, define and implement execution excellence, and coach and mentor team members for execution excellence
Evangelize evidence-based decision making by partnering with key decision makers and driving general accessibility of data and insights
Apply various data science methods to understand usage patterns of developers and builders who create on the Slack Platform
Perform evidence-based evaluations of the most important drivers of increased adoption of the Platform capabilities
Build out key success metrics and reporting for the Platform product organization
Prototype foundational data pipelines and partner with the data engineering organization to elevate these into canonical sources of truth for Platform metrics
Identify and communicate potential opportunities to improve the experience of users who want to build apps in Slack
Organize disparate facts and analyses into coherent narratives that evaluate the success of and influence product strategy
Set a compelling vision and prioritize work based on product strategies and overall goals
Partner closely with product researchers, align roadmaps and collaborate on projects to answer complex questions
Build strong partnership and alignment with our data cross-functional partners, including Data Engineering and Business Intelligence, to author and develop core data sets and empower operational and exploratory analysis
What you should have:
7+ years of experience in product data science in related tech industries, 2+ years experience in a product DS managerial role a plus
A consistent record of using data to drive product teams to achieve ambitious goals and influencing company-level outcomes.
BS degree in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Economics, Physics); An advanced degree (MS, PhD) in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Economics, Physics) a strong plus
Expertise in at least one programming language for data analysis (e.g. Python, R, Scala)
Experience working with data technologies that allow analysis of large amounts of data (e.g. Spark, Presto, Hive, Hadoop, etc). Familiarity with Apache Airflow is a strong plus.
Experience in schema design, data modeling, and building data pipelines.
Experience building frameworks, standards, and other tools to simplify and automate key data science and analytics work.

Technology is the engine that powers our foundation. It ensures we can reach massive scale and drives differentiation from any other healthcare company entering this space.

#TECH Company Description

We are building the world's largest in-home care system.

Healthcare is rapidly moving into the home, creating an enormous market opportunity that's growing daily as consumers increasingly demand more convenient healthcare options.

Technology is the engine that powers our foundation. It ensures we can reach massive scale and drives differentiation from any other healthcare company entering this space. We're using data to ensure patient safety and tailor the care to patients' specific needs which allows for better care delivery from patient onboarding, patient care, and post care follow-up.

DispatchHealth is a Series D startup with more than $400m in funding and a $1B+ valuation. We're backed by Oak, Tiger Global, Alta Partners, Optum Ventures, Questa Capital, ad EchoHealth Ventures.


Team Culture

We're a remote first org and our engineering team is spread out across the US, Mexico, and Ukraine. Our culture is focused on impact, accountability, and collaboration.

As a team, we share the goal of driving the company forward and transforming healthcare through the technology we build. We believe the only way we can accomplish our goal is together, and that our whole is greater than the sum of our parts. We collaborate closely across every function because we recognize that no individual function can solve the whole problem as well as we can when we all work together.

With our teammates spread out across different cities, we actively support each other and cultivate an environment where everyone is comfortable sharing ideas regardless of seniority or function, and where the best ideas consistently win. We know the positive feeling we get when we feel heard, and we reciprocate that deep engagement with others when they're talking or presenting so that we gain alignment and promote our collective actions.

Come join us on the journey to transform healthcare!

Retool,4.8,Data Scientist,"San Francisco, CA","ABOUT RETOOL:

Retool is changing the way software is built. We've developed the fastest way to build internal tools, saving companies time, resources, and engineering bandwidth. We're looking for the right people as we build a world-class team to support this mission.
WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:
Retool's user base is growing quickly, and we've found ourselves with more evidence to answer an increasing number of questions that drive our business and product. We're looking to hire a Data Scientist to take the lead on analysis and metrics to inform our product and business. We're looking for someone who is passionate about analyzing data across all domains, motivated by having an impact on the business and is constantly curious. This is the right role for someone who thrives from making sense of the blurry space that is data at high growth startup.

WHAT YOU'LL DO:
As an early member of the data team you'll play a pivotal role in building the data culture at Retool. Your scope will be broad — you'll work with almost every team at the company on problems from analyzing user behavior to architecting our event infrastructure to partnering with GTM teams on forecast models.

We'll look to you to help us establish KPIs and ensure we have the tooling to measure and access said KPIs. You'll apply statistical knowledge and the scientific method to the data questions we face today around product analytics and pricing, and help us think critically about the questions of tomorrow.

You'll also take on ownership of our data stack to ensure that your teammates are able to access the data they need to make decisions and technical teams are able to quickly implement events. We've already built out a solid stack on top of Segment, BigQuery, DBT and, of course, Retool, but we need your help to ensure it scales with the company as our user base grows.

Retool is a small but fast growing startup with more questions than answers and we're looking for someone who is excited to wear many hats and jump in wherever is needed. This means each day will be a little different and we'll look to you to juggle a variety of projects and deadlines. We are looking for someone who has a talent for finding a way forward with evidence-driven impact.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You'll be a part of our Data team, but really you'll work with almost every team at the company. You'll be expected to partner closely with internal stakeholders, and help identify areas of need and opportunity within the organization.

THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING:
3+ years of experience working on analytics, ideally at a high growth company or SaaS business.
Highly skilled at writing SQL. A strong enthusiasm for SQL, in all its flavors, is a plus.
Experience working with, or a healthy interest in and knowledge of, event driven infrastructure and ETL processes.
Comfortable with common git workflows and at least one scripting or statistical programming language(ideally Python and/or R).
A solution-oriented growth mindset.
A demonstrated knowledge of experiment design.
Experience partnering with cross-functional stakeholders.
Strong communication and presentation skills.

IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:

Work with product and business (marketing, sales, success, support) teams to identify key questions and answer them with data.
Develop key metrics and ensure observability via dashboards and other relevant tooling.
Apply analytical skills to understand user behavior.
Regularly communicate learnings to the company.
Lead the collection and modeling of data in our warehouse — from new sources to integrating existing sources.
Work with engineering to implement tracking and debug missing data. Yes, you'll be jumping into our Javascript code base.
Define tracking best practices.
Be a self starter.

OUR U.S. BENEFITS:

Generous medical, dental and vision benefits
401(K) plan enrollment and matching up to an effective rate of 4%
Paid company holidays and unlimited time off; take what you need!
Annual continuing education stipend
Paid parental leave and family planning support

PerfectRec,NA,Data Scientist,"Seattle, WA","About PerfectRec

PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)


We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.

We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.

A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact

PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.

Founder Led, Founder Funded

Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.

Working At PerfectRec

We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.

PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.

What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.

Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience

We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.

Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.
Salary & Benefits

We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.

Pay Range and Level of Role

$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.

Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.) About PerfectRec

 At Ford, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Vaccination has been proven to play a critical role in combatting COVID-19. As a result, Ford has made the decision to require U.S. salaried employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless employees require an accommodation for religious or medical reasons. Being fully vaccinated means that an individual is at least two weeks past their final dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine regimen. As a condition of employment, newly hired employees will be required to provide proof of their COVID-19 vaccination or an approved medical or religious exemption.

PerfectRec,NA,Data Scientist,"Seattle, WA","About PerfectRec

PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)


We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.

We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.

A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact

PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.

Founder Led, Founder Funded

Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.

Working At PerfectRec

We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.

PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.

What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.

Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience

We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.

Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.
Salary & Benefits

We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.

Pay Range and Level of Role

$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.

Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.) About PerfectRec

We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.

Pay Range and Level of Role

$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.

Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.) About PerfectRec

PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)


We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.

We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.

A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact

PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.

Founder Led, Founder Funded

Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.

Working At PerfectRec

We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.

PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.

What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.

Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience

We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.

Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.

Description
Tennessee (TN) demonstrates some of the highest rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the nation, and rates are on the rise. Driven by the opioid epidemic, the highest rates of HCV are among people who inject drugs, and specifically among people less than 40 years of age and living in rural areas. The purpose of this project is to enhance existing infrastructure to identify, engage, and refer individuals at high risk for bloodborne infections related to drug use, who would otherwise likely not have the support, resources, and/or ability to access needed services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded one-time federal funds to the TN Department of Health to address this crisis, and this is a contract position funded through December 31, 2023 with possible extension.
This nursing position will serve as one of the Harm Reduction Resource Team Nurses (HRRTs). This nursing position will identify, engage, and refer at-risk individuals to prevention and treatment services, including hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunizations, family planning, substance use disorder treatment, mental health services, syringe services programs, etc. Priority populations will include: 1) individuals tested for HCV in a TN local health department clinic and without evidence of current HCV infection (i.e., HCV Ab negative) but identified as a person who uses drugs (PWUD) or with a history of incarceration or 2) individuals testing HCV Ab positive/RNA negative.
This position could also be asked to provide surge capacity for community engagement/outreach (e.g., county jails, harm reduction coalitions) and during HIV or HCV cluster response, including: a) conducting enhanced risk factor assessments among persons identified as part of a HIV or HCV transmission cluster of significance; and b) supporting targeted prevention and linkage to care outreach activities
This nursing position will document all contact attempts and education/referrals provided in a project-specific database. This position is expected to participate in calls and meetings with project manager, Central Office HIV/HCV cluster response team, local DIS, epidemiologists, and/or clinical staff as requested. Further, this nursing position will coordinate with existing Viral Hepatitis Case Navigators (VHCNs) and the project manager to create/update regional provider directories, with an emphasis on services for PWUD, and hopefully will serve on-site at local community based organizations (CBOs) to provide phlebotomy for HCV testing and education related to viral hepatitis.
This nursing position will primarily serve East Tennessee and Knoxville-Knox County Public Health Regions. Regions can be viewed at the following link: https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/localdepartments.html

Description
Tennessee (TN) demonstrates some of the highest rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the nation, and rates are on the rise. Driven by the opioid epidemic, the highest rates of HCV are among people who inject drugs, and specifically among people less than 40 years of age and living in rural areas. The purpose of this project is to enhance existing infrastructure to identify, engage, and refer individuals at high risk for bloodborne infections related to drug use, who would otherwise likely not have the support, resources, and/or ability to access needed services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded one-time federal funds to the TN Department of Health to address this crisis, and this is a contract position funded through December 31, 2023 with possible extension.
This nursing position will serve as one of the Harm Reduction Resource Team Nurses (HRRTs). This nursing position will identify, engage, and refer at-risk individuals to prevention and treatment services, including hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunizations, family planning, substance use disorder treatment, mental health services, syringe services programs, etc. Priority populations will include: 1) individuals tested for HCV in a TN local health department clinic and without evidence of current HCV infection (i.e., HCV Ab negative) but identified as a person who uses drugs (PWUD) or with a history of incarceration or 2) individuals testing HCV Ab positive/RNA negative.
This position could also be asked to provide surge capacity for community engagement/outreach (e.g., county jails, harm reduction coalitions) and during HIV or HCV cluster response, including: a) conducting enhanced risk factor assessments among persons identified as part of a HIV or HCV transmission cluster of significance; and b) supporting targeted prevention and linkage to care outreach activities
This nursing position will document all contact attempts and education/referrals provided in a project-specific database. This position is expected to participate in calls and meetings with project manager, Central Office HIV/HCV cluster response team, local DIS, epidemiologists, and/or clinical staff as requested. Further, this nursing position will coordinate with existing Viral Hepatitis Case Navigators (VHCNs) and the project manager to create/update regional provider directories, with an emphasis on services for PWUD, and hopefully will serve on-site at local community based organizations (CBOs) to provide phlebotomy for HCV testing and education related to viral hepatitis.
This nursing position will primarily serve East Tennessee and Knoxville-Knox County Public Health Regions. Regions can be viewed at the following link: https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/localdepartments.html

Data Tecnica,5.0,Junior data scientist / bioinformatics,"Glen Echo, MD","Data Tecnica Int’l + NIH/NINDS
Open as of February 1st, 2021.
Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs). This opportunity focuses on aiding with data processing, management and analysis of dynamic cellular data in the contexts of both cellular and animal models.
The minimal qualifications of the candidate is a US citizen (or work permit holder) with some experience in bioinformatics, high performance computing, python programming and a basic knowledge of genomics. Ideally, a master’s degree in bioinformatics, neural computation, computational biology or biomedical data science would be best. This position is open immediately. This position is remote for the duration of at least one year, commensurate with ~1300 hours of work estimated for the calendar year.
Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs.
If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com.
Levine Lab Data Types: All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form.
Mouse behavior
Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar
Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles
Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc.
Cellular activity (post-hoc):
Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images
Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers
Cellular activity (dynamic):
Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal
Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the
broader population of recorded cells
Levine Lab Analysis Goals:
Data analysis:
Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space
Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar)
Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position)
Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions
Recording from different populations of neurons
Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types
Different behavioral/motivational contexts
Developmental age
Spinal cord injury
Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration
Data Modeling:
Physical forces/torques/biomechanics
Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys)
Dynamical systems modeling
Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior
Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration
Levine Lab SOW:
Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing.
The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data
The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member
The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI
The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative.
Levine Lab Background:
The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury.
To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery.
Ward Lab Data Types:
Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics
Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag
Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq
Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint
Ward Lab Analysis Goals:
Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets.
Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets
In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab
In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets)
Ward Lab SOW
Data analysis (as above)
The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data
The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI
The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI)
Ward Lab Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI:
Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible.
Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions.
Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI.
Ward Lab background:
The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.

Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.

Open as of February 1st, 2021.
Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs). This opportunity focuses on aiding with data processing, management and analysis of dynamic cellular data in the contexts of both cellular and animal models.
The minimal qualifications of the candidate is a US citizen (or work permit holder) with some experience in bioinformatics, high performance computing, python programming and a basic knowledge of genomics. Ideally, a master’s degree in bioinformatics, neural computation, computational biology or biomedical data science would be best. This position is open immediately. This position is remote for the duration of at least one year, commensurate with ~1300 hours of work estimated for the calendar year.
Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs.
If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com.
Levine Lab Data Types: All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form.
Mouse behavior
Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar
Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles
Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc.
Cellular activity (post-hoc):
Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images
Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers
Cellular activity (dynamic):
Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal
Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the
broader population of recorded cells
Levine Lab Analysis Goals:
Data analysis:
Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space
Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar)
Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position)
Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions
Recording from different populations of neurons
Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types
Different behavioral/motivational contexts
Developmental age
Spinal cord injury
Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration
Data Modeling:
Physical forces/torques/biomechanics
Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys)
Dynamical systems modeling
Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior
Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration
Levine Lab SOW:
Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing.
The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data
The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member
The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI
The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative.
Levine Lab Background:
The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury.
To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery.
Ward Lab Data Types:
Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics
Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag
Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq
Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint
Ward Lab Analysis Goals:
Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets.
Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets
In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab
In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets)
Ward Lab SOW
Data analysis (as above)
The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data

The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI)
Ward Lab Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI:
Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible.
Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions.
Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI.

Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs.
If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com.
Levine Lab Data Types: All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form.
Mouse behavior
Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar
Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles
Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc.
Cellular activity (post-hoc):
Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images
Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers
Cellular activity (dynamic):
Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal
Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the
broader population of recorded cells
Levine Lab Analysis Goals:
Data analysis:
Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space
Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar)
Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position)
Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions
Recording from different populations of neurons
Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types
Different behavioral/motivational contexts
Developmental age
Spinal cord injury
Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration
Data Modeling:
Physical forces/torques/biomechanics
Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys)
Dynamical systems modeling
Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior
Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration
Levine Lab SOW:
Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing.
The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data
The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member
The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI
The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative.
Levine Lab Background:
The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury.
To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery.
Ward Lab Data Types:
Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics
Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag
Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq
Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint
Ward Lab Analysis Goals:
Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets.
Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets
In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab
In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets)
Ward Lab SOW
Data analysis (as above)
The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data
The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI
The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI)
Ward Lab Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI:
Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible.
Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions.
Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI.
Ward Lab background:
The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease. Data Tecnica Int’l + NIH/NINDS
Open as of February 1st, 2021.
Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs).

DispatchHealth is a Series D startup with more than $400m in funding and a $1B+ valuation. We're backed by Oak, Tiger Global, Alta Partners, Optum Ventures, Questa Capital, ad EchoHealth Ventures.


Team Culture

We're a remote first org and our engineering team is spread out across the US, Mexico, and Ukraine. Our culture is focused on impact, accountability, and collaboration.

As a team, we share the goal of driving the company forward and transforming healthcare through the technology we build. We believe the only way we can accomplish our goal is together, and that our whole is greater than the sum of our parts. We collaborate closely across every function because we recognize that no individual function can solve the whole problem as well as we can when we all work together.

With our teammates spread out across different cities, we actively support each other and cultivate an environment where everyone is comfortable sharing ideas regardless of seniority or function, and where the best ideas consistently win. We know the positive feeling we get when we feel heard, and we reciprocate that deep engagement with others when they're talking or presenting so that we gain alignment and promote our collective actions.

Come join us on the journey to transform healthcare!
