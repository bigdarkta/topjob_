Introduction to the role
Our work makes a difference. Millions of people use our fact checking each year, including most of the major internet companies. We get powerful people and institutions to correct the record, including politicians and the national media.

The scale of the challenge we are facing is huge. Every day we identify nearly 100,000 things to potentially fact check and we are looking to recruit a Data Scientist to help us identify the most important of these, to help build tools to make the process of fact checking faster and to ensure that we get the very most out of every fact check we publish.
Full Fact has placed a significant focus on the use of technology to address bad information for a number of years. You will be the third data scientist to join us and the 9th person in our wider technical team.

You will be joining as we start to make the tools we have made so far available to other fact checkers around the world and your role will be specifically looking to use ML and NLP techniques to help address the needs of fact checkers around the globe.


Working at Full Fact is more than just building tools. We are looking for people who want to improve the news and politics ecosystems and who have thought deeply about the nuance and complexity that exists within the space. We are also looking for people who are willing to make a real commitment to impartiality and to safeguarding that impartiality.

If you are interested in applying but not sure you have all the skills, please do apply. We are open both to supporting learning on the job and to rearranging tasks within the team to suit the skillsets of the best applicant
Job Definition
Full Fact uses NLP and ML to power tools built to aid fact checkers’ analysis of news and other information. This helps give fact-checkers more time to focus on research, analysis, and writing articles that contextualise the news and help all of us make more informed decisions.
This Data Scientist role is a new addition to our team and aims to expand our ability to process a wide range of information and to identify statements that might need to be reviewed and to look for patterns in online and broadcast media information that may help us prioritise the topics that we check, find repeats of things we have previously fact checked and ensure that every part of our AI pipeline works in multiple spoken languages

Outcomes

Developing systems and techniques to help us build out different stages of our automated fact checking system, including:

Identifying sightings of previously checked claims at real-time speed

Spotting candidate claims across a broad range of media

Checking candidate claims against known datasets

Helping to integrate the technologies you build into products that will have an immediate use, for both fact checkers and journalists

Measuring and improving the quality of the system

Using NLP, ML, and data automation to push the boundaries of what's possible

What we are looking for from you
Political impartiality and sensitivity:
You are committed to the political neutrality of our work and have a good understanding of impartiality (please see the rules on our website).
Understanding of public debate in the UK and sensitivity to the political context we work in.
Job skills/competencies

You have a good understanding of Natural Language Processing and used this in an applicable context

You have a good awareness of Machine Learning techniques

You are comfortable doing rapid prototyping and breaking down large problems into solvable ones

Ideally you've done a research project in NLP, Knowledge Extraction, Information Retrieval or ML at MSc or PhD level and/or have considerable experience in an applicable industry.
You’ll be building systems, so you should be a strong engineer too. We currently use Python for this although if you are happy to learn it doesn’t matter which languages you’ve used previously

Personal skills/competencies

You are comfortable working in an Agile way

You are an excellent communicator and can explain the concepts behind your work to a non technical audience.

You should be excited about pushing forward the state of the art for automated fact checking

What we offer
Starting salary of £41,000 - £56,000 depending on experience.
Workplace Pension
Generous holidays

25 days holiday plus bank holidays.
In addition, we close the office for a period between Christmas and New Year.
Day off for moving home.

Comfortable, centrally located London office with good transport links.
Employee Assistance Programme.

Before applying, please read the requirements we place on staff to protect Full Fact’s independence and non-partisanship. https://fullfact.org/jobs/#standards
How the application process will work
We want to see you at your best to understand your strengths and the contribution you could make at Full Fact with strong support, including for your learning and development.

Our Purpose:
Fandom connects people with shared passions and builds communities around them. It offers them space to express their joy and love, whether that’s for superheroes, sports teams, or even small batch whiskeys. At MarketCast, we believe in the power of fandom. It’s as important for brands as it is for action heroes and we do fandom research, data science and analytics better than anyone on the planet. This obsessive focus on fans helps the world’s top creators, media platforms, and sports leagues transform followers into fanatics and investments into impact.
Our Values:
Curiosity Makes Us Tick
Our love of learning manifests in everything we do - from the surveys we field and the datasets we analyze to the technology we develop. Where others pause, we push forward, uncovering hidden meaning and answers. Always learning, always looking for more.
We Celebrate Wins
Whether its wowing clients with research or solving everyday challenges, we pause to honor great work and everyone who plays a role in it. We acknowledge and recognize great work and hustle that helps deliver the very best outcomes.
Trust is Always Trending
Trust means everything to us. It’s lending a hand when deadlines loom, always delivering on the promises we make, and calling out behavior that harms our culture. And our client’s trust is what makes all this possible, something we never take for granted.
We Roll with Change
We embrace change as an opportunity to learn, grow, and further develop. We do this by challenging our biases and rethinking how things have always been done in the past. This fresh, open-minded approach keeps us agile, innovating, and adapting in the face of uncertainty.
Diversity is Our Superpower
Our differences make us stronger. As researchers and data scientists, we have a responsibility to reflect the diverse audiences and communities all around us. Understanding people, opinions and life experiences fuels our insights and deepens our perspectives.
At MarketCast, we don't just accept difference - we embrace it, support it, and thrive on it for the benefit of our global culture and success. MarketCast is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know.

Working for us will present you with the opportunity to get involved in high profile projects and will enable you to expand your horizons.
We encourage consideration of flexible ways of working, both formal and informal arrangements that allow for the best outcomes for our people and our clients. If this opportunity is of interest to you with some flexibility, please do discuss with us.

Clearly and confidently articulate the value and benefits of delivering analytics projects to clients
Working closely with tax SMEs to build a deep understanding of business/client challenges and in the development of POCs

We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process.

What do we value?
What brings us all together at Deloitte? it's how we approach the thousands of decisions we make every day. How we behave, our beliefs and our attitudes. In other words: our values. Whatever we do, wherever we are in the world, we lead the way, serve with integrity, take care of each other, foster inclusion, and collaborate for maximum impact. These five shared values lead every decision we make and action we take, guiding us to deliver impact how and where it matters most.
Being a Leader at Deloitte
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation.
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what We're looking for:
We live our purpose: we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognising others for the impact they make
We develop talent: we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities
We drive performance: we deliver exceptional client service; maximise results and drive high performance from people while fostering collaboration across businesses and borders
We believe positive influence can make an impact that matters: we influence clients, teams, and individuals positively, leading by example and establishing confident relationships with increasingly senior people
We move, together, towards a strategic direction: we understand key objectives for clients and Deloitte, aligning people to objectives and setting priorities and direction.

Your opportunity
This is your opportunity to join Deloitte Ventures, an exciting and entrepreneurial part of the firm – the home of our product and engineering teams, as well as our venture incubators and studios. We bring together creative problem solvers, doers and makers from all walks of life, united by a drive to help make change happen – in our own business, and for our clients. Together, we see a better future. And then create it.
Our Tax Ventures team is expanding its AI & Data capabilities, supporting Deloitte's UK tax business in developing and delivering data and machine learning driven products and solutions.
A key area of focus will be our market leading advisory arm of our Global Employer Services group which has grown rapidly over the last 5 years in both size and breadth of services. To continue that growth and explore other market differentiating opportunities across the entire tax business, we need high calibre and motivated individuals. Our Tax Ventures team has quickly established a strong reputation for being proactive, entrepreneurial, successful and fun to work with. Working for us will present you with the opportunity to get involved in high profile projects and will enable you to expand your horizons.
We encourage consideration of flexible ways of working, both formal and informal arrangements that allow for the best outcomes for our people and our clients. If this opportunity is of interest to you with some flexibility, please do discuss with us.
Your role
Deloitte's Tax Ventures team is a key strategic function within the tax business and includes a number of future looking capabilities that combined, are helping to drive exciting and innovative growth opportunities. You'll work as part of a multi-disciplinary team of industry, tax SMEs, technology and analytics specialists to provide specialist data science expertise and support on a diverse range of projects with both an internal and client focus.
Your role will be as the lead Data Scientist within our expanding AI & Data Studio. The role involves working on new and existing projects and products, delivering insights to clients, and utilising data to make smarter, better decisions. You will be responsible for applying data mining techniques, undertaking statistical analysis, deploying cutting edge machine learning tools and techniques and drawing insights and building predictive models on both structured and unstructured data.
This role will involve working on the delivery of key data science driven services and transformation projects.
Responsibilities:
Proactively sourcing additional external structured and unstructured data sets to enhance services and insights
Processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis
Performing ad-hoc analysis and presenting results from a business-centric perspective
Creating anomaly detection systems and perform constant tracking of performance
Clearly and confidently articulate the value and benefits of delivering analytics projects to clients
Working closely with tax SMEs to build a deep understanding of business/client challenges and in the development of POCs
Your work, your choice
At Deloitte we believe the best impact is the value we add, not the hours we sit at our desk. We carefully consider agile ways of working, both formal and informal, that allow for the best impact for our people and our clients. Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you.
Location: Your home office will be London, but this client-facing role provides lots of opportunity for travel in the UK and overseas.
Work pattern: This is a permanent contract opportunity. The role can be worked on a full-time basis. Our team members work a variety of agile working patterns. Tell us what arrangement works for you and we'll try to accommodate.
Your professional experience
Essential:
Deep understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms
Experience with common data science toolkits- for example Python, R, Alteryx, SSIS, SPSS
Proficiency in Microsoft SQL language
Strong statistics skills including distributions, statistical testing, regression, etc.
Experience in working with unstructured data sets
Good scripting and programming skills to allow integration with existing services using Microsoft technologies
Data and analytical orientated mind-set
Experience in developing and testing predictive algorithms
Desirable:
 Experience with data visualisation tools such as Qlikview and Tableau preferred
Your service line: Tax Consulting
Arguably the most stimulating career environment in our industry, tax at Deloitte is a far cry from tax at other firms. Here, it's all about collaborating with colleagues at the top of their game, across disciplines, for clients who urge us to constantly push the boundaries of our creativity. You'll find a diverse mix of people, all working together to deliver best-in-class advice. And You'll discover a structured programme that will help you develop even greater expertise. From fascinating projects to a wealth of secondment opportunities, both in the UK and overseas, you can enjoy a broad and rich career experience.
Personal independence
Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process.

What brings us all together at Deloitte? it's how we approach the thousands of decisions we make every day. How we behave, our beliefs and our attitudes. In other words: our values. Whatever we do, wherever we are in the world, we lead the way, serve with integrity, take care of each other, foster inclusion, and collaborate for maximum impact. These five shared values lead every decision we make and action we take, guiding us to deliver impact how and where it matters most.
Being a Leader at Deloitte
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation.
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what We're looking for:
We live our purpose: we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognising others for the impact they make
We develop talent: we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities
We drive performance: we deliver exceptional client service; maximise results and drive high performance from people while fostering collaboration across businesses and borders
We believe positive influence can make an impact that matters: we influence clients, teams, and individuals positively, leading by example and establishing confident relationships with increasingly senior people
We move, together, towards a strategic direction: we understand key objectives for clients and Deloitte, aligning people to objectives and setting priorities and direction.

Medialab,3.4,JUNIOR DATA SCIENTIST/ANALYST - 1 YEAR UNIVERSITY PLACEMENT - 2023 INTAKE,"London, England","Applications for our Summer 2023 intake will open in October 2022 but you can register your interest early here.

Are you interested in learning and working in the world of data with its application into media and marketing? Does the world of innovative digital marketing grab your attention? Would you like to experience working at a fast-growing, independently owned agency based in central London just off Oxford Circus?
If the answer to all the above is ‘YES!’ then look no further than Medialab.
We’re a rapidly growing team which means there is lots of scope for you to develop your skills during your placement year. We’re also known as market-leaders in our field, and we have a very happy client base which we’re proud of, including major brands such as Laithwaite’s Wine and SunLife as well as several charities, including The National Trust, Guide Dogs Association for the Blind, Alzheimer’s Society and Mind.
We are looking for inquisitive, articulate, numerate, and above all eager placement students to support the wider team in improving campaign performance and the understanding of consumer behaviour gained through the analysis of client data.
Our business is built around our unique marketing intelligence platform Apollo – a technology that turns data into insights we can act on. Importantly, this tool centralises and automates the data collection process, meaning our modelling team can focus on developing the story and strategy to be recommended to clients, rather than data processing typically associated with these roles.
The team are young, fun and not afraid of hard-work and over-delivering on client expectations – and you’ll need to be part of this ethos. Applications for our Summer 2023 intake will open in October 2022 but you can register your interest early here.

City of Westminster Council,3.7,Data Scientist,"City of Westminster, England","About Us:

THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF 809 CONNECTED BUSINESSES
Digital and Innovation in Westminster City Council is a world of extraordinary stories, where creative and enterprising people put local residents and businesses first.
Today, Westminster is the most connected borough in London. But, when David joined us in the mid-2010s, small businesses were still struggling to get connected to fibre. Without gigabit-capable broadband, some companies even resorted to biking memory sticks around the city, simply to share files with clients.
Although still in a junior role, David took the initiative and successfully made the business case for £2.8 million of European funding to support connectivity for small businesses across Westminster. Feedback from businesses has been overwhelmingly positive as the project has enhanced their communications with clients, the new connectivity allows them to make video calls and work remotely. As the pandemic hit and many more people needed to work from home, it became clear just how vital this investment had been.
Fast-forward a few years. Westminster is leading the way for connectivity, as a result of the project businesses are thriving and David is heading up a service of his own responsible for delivery of the smart city strategy.
The Role:

As Data Scientist, you can make your own powerful contribution.
That means working across our entire Digital and Innovation portfolio to greatly expand our data capabilities, in turn transforming the way we deliver crucial services.

Leading a small team of data analysts, you’ll use a wide range of data science techniques to create valuable insights and predictions which we can use to inform service delivery. You’ll also help improve our decision-making across key service-specific and council-wide innovation projects.

As part of these duties, you’ll build and run data products and services which can consistently deliver high-quality insights. While using the best of modern data platforms, you’ll also carry out research into emerging technologies. Ensuring a high-quality user experience for staff and residents who are using data is also an important element of your work.
On top of this, you’ll inspire the rest of the Council with the possibilities of being a truly data-driven organisation, shaping our wider culture for the better.
Above all, the role is a chance to significantly change the way a high-profile local authority serves its residents. We’re proud of record as a council, and this is an opportunity to build even further on our reputation.
Please refer to the Job Description for more information.

About You:

We’re looking for experience in a range of areas, including modern data practices, data architecture, machine learning techniques, developing algorithms and leading a small team.
You should also have experience leading significant data projects, delivering wider strategies and working with data in the public sector.
You’ll have excellent communication skills, especially when it comes to explaining complex ideas to non-technical audiences. You’ll also need proficiency in query languages, databases, programming languages, data visualisation tools and applied statistics.
We’re also looking for people with a huge intellectual curiosity and a genuine passion for learning and self-development.
The Council and its partners are committed to achieving diverse shortlists for all vacancies at Band 4 or above to support our desire to increase the number of staff from underrepresented groups in our workforce. As part of this ambition, if you are from a Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds (B.A.ME) you can self-declare this to the hiring manager as part of our positive action commitments.
What We Offer:

Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride.

We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities.

At Westminster City Council, we are passionate about our aim to be an inclusive workplace for all that reflects the communities we serve, and we believe everyone is valued. We particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, including B.A.ME, Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ and those with hidden or visible disabilities. We’re committed to ensuring all our staff – regardless of gender, age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity or disability – can succeed. We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way. About Us:

Data Scientist/Senior Data Scientist – Customer Understanding

We’re looking for Data Scientists to join our growing Marketing and Product Teams in London. This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on Wise’s mission, grow as a Data Scientist (developing cutting-edge techniques) and help save our customers money.

Your mission:

Wise has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world’s first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. Your mission is to help make people aware of Wise as a solution for cross-border money needs, and help us target our offering to better serve existing customers.

Here’s how you’ll be contributing to Marketing and Product

You will help the Marketing and Product tribes find the biggest growth opportunities by measuring the incremental effect that marketing campaigns and product changes have on business metrics
You will use causal inference to decide which campaigns and features should be delivered to each user. You will help own and develop our groundbreaking open-source framework for automatic causal model selection (auto-causality)
You will model customer behaviour data and product usage so we understand which audiences to target and how (LTV/churn modelling, neural-lifetimes package)
You will understand the varying needs and responses of different groups of our customers (Customer Segmentation, in particular using state of the art causal inference models)
You will work closely with Data Analysts and you will help them understand and use models that you build (Causal Inference, LTV, and Customer Segmentation models)

A bit about you:

You have a good understanding of causal inference concepts and have some experience with machine learning models for causal inference.
You are familiar with lifetime value (LTV) modelling and customer segmentation
You have experience with Bayesian approaches to machine learning, as well as with using neural networks, ideally PyTorch
You have a good understanding of statistics, in particular Bayesian reasoning, and can estimate how accurate your results are, but also know when to stop analysing and deliver results
You are familiar with a range of model types, and know when and why to use gradient boosting, neural networks, good old linear regression, or a blend of these
You have a solid knowledge of Python, and are able to make and justify design decisions in your Python code; you can throw together a REST service or a UI if need be. You’ve used external data pulled via APIs before

We’re people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you’re passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you’ll fit right in.

Also, qualifications aren’t that important to us. If you’ve got great experience, and you’re great at articulating your thinking, we’d like to hear from you.

And because we believe that diverse teams build better products, we’d especially love to hear from you if you’re from an under-represented demographic.

You are familiar with a range of model types, and know when and why to use gradient boosting, neural networks, good old linear regression, or a blend of these
You have a solid knowledge of Python, and are able to make and justify design decisions in your Python code; you can throw together a REST service or a UI if need be. You’ve used external data pulled via APIs before

We’re people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you’re passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you’ll fit right in.

 Data Scientist/Senior Data Scientist – Customer Understanding

We’re looking for Data Scientists to join our growing Marketing and Product Teams in London. This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on Wise’s mission, grow as a Data Scientist (developing cutting-edge techniques) and help save our customers money.

Your mission:

Wise has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world’s first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. Your mission is to help make people aware of Wise as a solution for cross-border money needs, and help us target our offering to better serve existing customers.

Here’s how you’ll be contributing to Marketing and Product

You will help the Marketing and Product tribes find the biggest growth opportunities by measuring the incremental effect that marketing campaigns and product changes have on business metrics
You will use causal inference to decide which campaigns and features should be delivered to each user. You will help own and develop our groundbreaking open-source framework for automatic causal model selection (auto-causality)
You will model customer behaviour data and product usage so we understand which audiences to target and how (LTV/churn modelling, neural-lifetimes package)
You will understand the varying needs and responses of different groups of our customers (Customer Segmentation, in particular using state of the art causal inference models)
You will work closely with Data Analysts and you will help them understand and use models that you build (Causal Inference, LTV, and Customer Segmentation models)

A bit about you:

You have a good understanding of causal inference concepts and have some experience with machine learning models for causal inference.
You are familiar with lifetime value (LTV) modelling and customer segmentation
You have experience with Bayesian approaches to machine learning, as well as with using neural networks, ideally PyTorch

Does working as a Data Scientist on a unique historical programme at the heart of our capital city sound like the kind of challenge you would relish? If so, come and be part of our structure for success.
The Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal (R&R) Programme is set to be the UKâ€™s biggest and most complex ever renovation programme. Significant work is needed to protect and preserve this UNESCO World Heritage site and ensure it can continue to serve as the home of the UK Parliament in the 21st Century. Weâ€™re looking for people with a passion for data science and a real desire to help shape our future to take on this brand-new role within our Data and Digital department.
This challenging role sits within our Data team and will provide you with a unique opportunity to establish our data science capability. But thatâ€™s not all. As the programme progresses, youâ€™ll also get to play your part in co-creating a data function and designing capability that will help us deliver some truly complex and high-profile works in a safe, data-driven and cost-effective manner. Along the way, weâ€™ll rely on you to work across the programme to understand where data science can add value. Developing models/prototypes, creating and evolving a data science toolkit, enhancing our data platform and helping deliver Digital Construction capabilities â€“ youâ€™ll get to do this and more, including working extensively with 3D Models, imagery point clouds and a wide range of archive data.
To succeed, youâ€™ll need an appreciation of data technologies and a proven ability to use data analytics, visualisations and dashboarding platforms such as PowerBI, Tableau, Qlik or equivalent. Youâ€™ll also need experience of design and test machine-learning (ML/AI) models using software/libraries such as Spark, Tensorflow or equivalent. You will deliver value through the application of data science and take an interest in Digital Construction and the Built Environment. Whatâ€™s more, youâ€™re able to empathise with business users and talk â€˜in humanâ€™ and have a real desire to learn and gain new skills in what promises to be a stimulating environment.
We are committed to promoting diversity and to equal opportunities in employment. We are building diverse teams and seek to attract and retain talented individuals from a range of backgrounds and cultures to join us on this hugely challenging and important project.

Monzo,3.6,Senior Data Scientist,"London, England","We're looking for a Senior Product Data Scientist excited to help build the bank of the future. You'll have the opportunity to super charge our user engagement in 2021 and help us to build a bank that customers truly love.

At Monzo, we're building a bank that is fair, transparent and a delight to use. We're growing extremely fast and have over four and half million customers in the UK, with over 100,000 new people joining every month. We've built a product that people love and more than 80% of our growth comes from word of mouth and referrals.

Our Product Analytics team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of day-to-day data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.

We work in cross-functional squads where every data scientist is a member of a central data discipline and fully embedded into 1 product squad alongside engineers, designers, marketers, product managers etc.

As part of your role, you'll:
Apply your expertise in quantitative analysis, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with our products and how those insights can inform our product strategy
Guide and enable product teams to measure things that matter; initiate or help run A/B experiments to keep improving everything we do
Drive together with the finance team a unified company-wide understanding of the lifetime value of our users and how different product features are impacting user profitability
Liaise with engineers to keep making sure we collect the right data to produce relevant business insights
What's special about data at Monzo?

Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. All of our infrastructure is designed so that we can have really high data quality, and spend most of our time using that data to support business decisions.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:
What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and very importantly your colleagues as well
You're commercially minded and can put numbers into business perspective
You're as comfortable getting hands-on as taking a step back and thinking strategically
You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You have experience in conducting large scale A/B experiments
Nice to haves:
You have experience in product or growth analytics, preferably in a fast moving tech company
Logistics
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office or remotely within the UK
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
The application process consists of a 30 min phone call with a recruiter, an initial call with someone from the team, followed by a practical written exercise and 2-3 video interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions - you can get a feel for our hiring processes here.

COVID-19 Considerations 
We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.  
In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Why Product Madness?
Product Madness is so much more than just a Pool table and a foosball game.
We believe in an honest and transparent approach with our teammates. Company wide weekly Town Halls, All Hands and strategy meetings are just a few ways in which we encourage an open and honest path to achieving complete transparency.
Despite a pandemic, there isn’t a day where we don’t feel connected to one another.
With frequent events, workshops, giveaways, slack coffee and donut sessions we have definitely brought on our office culture to this new virtual world of zoom calls.
We also try to cater for all our staff’s needs – be that a freshly brewed cappuccino made by our professional barista in our free coffee shop or by providing a bountiful supply of tasty snacks to keep us refueled and buzzing.
We love to organise plenty of social get-togethers and action-packed activity days, be it slipping inside an inflatable bumper ball for a mad session of football zorbing or throwing caution to the wind and traversing giddy treetop rope courses at Go Ape. On top of these team-building activities, our lunch and learn workshops, not to mention the lavish Christmas and summer parties, foster that ‘work hard, play hard’ mantra. Our offices are based in the heart of the metropolises of London and Lviv, surrounded by an abundance of diversity and inspiration to keep those ideas flowing.
Our Values
People First
We have the deepest respect for our people and their well being. We know they are exceptionally talented and will always have a choice. We want them to re-choose us every day. We are committed to building a culture where each person's voice will always be heard and addressed.
MAD for More
Always improving, innovating and never settling for the existing. We push all boundaries with courage and ambition to become the world’s best games company.
Champion Together

We excel at what we do but yet remain humble and helpful to our teammates. We champion one another and hold each other to high standards without any egos.
Globally Inclusive
We are all Equal - regardless of the language we speak, where we live, our gender, religion or culture we come from. We want to build a global home, where everyone has the equal opportunity to make an impact.
Customer Focused
We always think from the customer's perspective - be it players or internal customers.
Improving their experience and joy is what drives us. Every client's success is our big win!

CarbonChain,NA,Data Scientist,"London, England","Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?

We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant engineers, designers, and data scientists who want to help define a low carbon future.

Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. We were part of the Y Combinator Summer 2020 batch and have secured backing from the UK government's innovation arm, InnovateUK, the NatWest accelerator and the London Business School Incubator.
To join Carbon Chain, you'll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of 10 passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.

What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?

As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding.

We're a small team of versatile technologists and we don't believe in a siloed approach. Our data scientists sit side by side with software engineers and designers, making sure that we have the data we need to provide the experience our customers want. You'll be deeply embedded in the product team, with your work being deployed to clients every week. You'll work closely with our domain experts, and have the chance to present to clients if that's something that excites you.

You can expect to have:

Ownership of your projects
An independent path to production
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value

Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.

Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology, the ability to build close relationships with your team, and the right to work in the UK.

Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.

You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.

What we require from applicants
Right to work in the UK and willingness to come to London office 2+ days a week
1+ years of commercial Data Science experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What we're offering
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
Flexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week)
£1000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Team lunch on Wednesdays, and frequent pub trips
Pakt coffee and snacks of your choice in the office
28 days holiday + bank holidays

We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.
If you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch! Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?

Engineering culture & best practices

Continuous deployment to production
Metrics and data driven decision making
Highly flexible working culture – a focus on doing great work and achieving great results with less on focus on working hours or how you do this
Incredibly autonomous engineering team – the company feed into the long term roadmap priorities but engineering and product then have autonomy to deliver as they see fit
We allocate at least 10% of every sprint to technical debt, architecture and refactoring

The technology stack

We use collaborative filtering algorithms, helped with natural language processing (NLP).
It relies mainly on python3, pandas, scikit learn and nltk
Our data is mainly stored in an elasticsearch cluster

The ideal candidate

Yelp,3.5,Applied Scientist (Remote),"Manchester, England","Are you intrigued by data? Yelp has hundreds of millions of pieces of user-contributed content, millions of users and business listings, and hundreds of thousands of advertising customers – and all of these numbers are constantly growing. Making sense of this data, deducing relationships between variables, and figuring out different interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. They work in areas including pricing models and auction bidding strategies, learning to rank applications, personalized recommender systems, trust and safety / spam detection, and causal inference.
Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that encourages individual authenticity and “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new team members to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor, and team. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers and scientists, and having fun in a collaborative environment.
This opportunity requires you to be located in the United Kingdom.

What It Takes to Succeed:
Experience with data analysis/statistical software and packages (pandas/statsmodels/sklearn within Python, R, etc.).
Experience with predictive modeling/machine learning, forecasting, or causal inference.
A degree in a quantitative discipline such as Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Applied Math, etc.
A love for writing beautiful code; you don’t need to be an expert, but experience is a plus and we’ll expect you to learn on the job.
A demonstrated capability for original research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.
Comfortable working in a Unix environment.
What You'll Get:
Full responsibility for projects from day one, a collaborative team, and a dynamic work environment.
Competitive salary with equity in the company, a pension scheme, and an optional employee stock purchase plan.
25 days paid holiday (rising to 29 with service), plus one floating holiday.

Yelp values diversity. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and consider qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, medical condition, disability, or any other protected status.
Note: Yelp does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to any recruiting alias or employee. Yelp is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes. Are you intrigued by data? Yelp has hundreds of millions of pieces of user-contributed content, millions of users and business listings, and hundreds of thousands of advertising customers – and all of these numbers are constantly growing. Making sense of this data, deducing relationships between variables, and figuring out different interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. They work in areas including pricing models and auction bidding strategies, learning to rank applications, personalized recommender systems, trust and safety / spam detection, and causal inference.
Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that encourages individual authenticity and “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new team members to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor, and team. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers and scientists, and having fun in a collaborative environment.
This opportunity requires you to be located in the United Kingdom.
We’d love to have you apply, even if you don't feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.
Where You Come In:
Identify and own challenging problems, form testable hypotheses, and drive significant business impact.

ASOS,3.6,Machine Learning Scientist - Deep Learning,"London, England","Company Description
We're ASOS. We blend our flair for fashion with our love of cutting- edge technology, but more importantly were interested in how we can bring the best out of you.
We exist to give people the confidence to be whoever they want to be, and that goes for our people too. At ASOS, you're free to be your true self without judgment, and channel your creativity into a platform used by millions.

Job Description
ASOS is one of the UK's top fashion and beauty destinations, expanding globally at a rapid pace. Our values are to be authentic, brave and creative, and we live and breathe these in everything we do.
Digital Experience at ASOS is all about finding new ways to improve our customers' shopping experiences. Thinking about what our customers really want from their shopping experience keeps the User Experience team awake at night (well, busy in the day!). Their job is to create the most usable and engaging experience possible. Our digital analytics team spend their days understanding where our users come from and what they do when they're on the site. We want to know how they find us, the devices they use, how they interact with the site, and how successful we are at converting them into customers.
About the Role
As a machine learning scientist, you will be part of a cross-functional team focused on our digital experience (such as personalisation, search or ranking). We passionately believe that cross-functional working is the key to any successful machine learning production system. The whole team is responsible for the end-to-end system, and we are all accountable for making sure it performs in production.
You will be focused on framing digital experience problems as machine learning problems using multiple rich sources (image, text) and large volume sources (clickstream). You will help build models using deep learning frameworks that can be served at scale using large volumes of data and big data technologies.
You will participate in conducting large-scale experiments to test hypotheses and drive product development. You will keep up to date with relevant state-of-the-art research by attending and publishing at top conferences as well as taking part and leading reading groups alongside other scientists,
At ASOS, as an online only retailer, we have unique datasets -transactions and click streams for millions of customers and photos, videos, and text descriptions of hundreds of thousands of products.

Qualifications
About You
You have a background in Machine Learning and previous experience applying state of the art deep learning and machine learning methods to solve complex problems either in academia or industry.
You have a broad understanding of machine learning theory and in-depth knowledge of deep learning. You are comfortable exploring and defining the problem and choosing the appropriate machine learning technique to solve it.
You thrive in cross-functional teams, including scientists, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders. You are approachable, collaborative and you actively nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace.
You are comfortable working in Python software stacks and familiar with at least one deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch) and enjoy going from ideas and prototypes into products and applications. You have experience working with data from multiple sources, involving complex/high - dimensional data (e.g. image, clickstreams, text, video, speech, time series).
We would love to meet someone who has authored publications in top-tier machine learning conferences or journals (such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, KDD, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACL, EMNLP) and want to keep up to date with the state of the art.
You like to learn from others as well as mentor. You enjoy working and collaborating with other scientists to solve complex problems. You actively innovate, encouraging innovation within your team and you are not afraid to take risks to deliver maximum impact. You have effective communication skills and can facilitate discussions across teams and with business stakeholders. You are excellent at explaining complex data science concepts to non-technical audiences.

You are data-driven with a structured and pedantic approach. You need to be able to independently prioritise the value you can add, and manage your time effectively
You see a bigger picture of business processes and can interview all the stakeholders and cut through vagueness to define precisely where and how a model would fit into our stack and what value it would add
You always seek optimal solutions but also understand the trade-off between quality and practicality
You are a good storyteller and are comfortable with visualising and communicating data to various audiences; you easily articulate and present your ideas.

Some extra skills that are great (but not essential):

You are familiar with finance, trading or accounting terminology so that it's easier for you to understand, evaluate and explain implications of product decisions in Treasury.

We're people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you're passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you'll fit right in.

Also, qualifications aren't that important to us. If you've got great experience, and you're great at articulating your thinking, we'd like to hear from you.

And because we believe that diverse teams build better products, we'd especially love to hear from you if you're from an under-represented demographic.

You will also develop superb analytical skills and become competent and confident in using data and evidence to create compelling and persuasive arguments.


The successful candidate will be a collaborative team-worker with excellent diplomacy, who is able to understand the high-level needs of colleagues across the department and translate digital data analysis into customer intelligence and insight.


You will be comfortable working independently as well as within a team and have the drive and intuition to identify key improvement projects – bringing high-level benefits to the division and the department, with a passion for accuracy, and a proven track record of positive outcomes.


Using these skills, you will build relationships and work in partnership with teams across the department, using data and intelligence to improve the department’s content on GOV.UK, bringing about tangible benefits to our users.

We fulfil the department’s responsibility for democratic accountability, through Ministers’ responses to MPs, and the department’s interaction with the public.


In the DfE Customer Analysis, Research and Briefing Team, we are dedicated to turning data analysis into customer intelligence to improve our channels options and user journeys in ‘real time.’ To do this we work in tandem with our partners in the digital communications team who aim to make it simpler, clearer, and easier to find online content, by managing and creating engaging web content on GOV.UK and integrating this with wider digital communications.

Alongside data manipulation and interrogation experience, you will develop the ability to understand and identify the needs of users, as well as map their journeys through content. You will also develop superb analytical skills and become competent and confident in using data and evidence to create compelling and persuasive arguments.

If you wish to find out more about the Data Science Degree Apprenticeship, click here: https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/data-scientist-integrated-degree/.


You will benefit from an initial induction event in a London college campus and will also attend immersive bootcamps delivered by our chosen training provider, where you will get the opportunity to develop core skills fundamental to the role and be fully supported by experienced technical coaches throughout, who will guide you to produce a portfolio of work demonstrating your learning.


You will be given sufficient time to allow you to complete your apprenticeship within your working hours, and you’ll be supported by your line manager, skills coach and the community, as well as fellow apprentices on the programme, so you will have plenty of sources of encouragement to help you succeed. Some study and travel outside normal working hours will also be required on occasion. There’s a lot to learn and do, so you need to be ready to be proactive, work hard and participate in the many opportunities you’ll be given to showcase your skills.


We anticipate that the successful candidate will take up the post on 26 September 2022.

Job description
This post is based in the Customer Analysis, Research and Briefing team which is part of the department’s Ministerial and Public Communications Division. The division provides a range of high-quality services, including digital communications; Parliamentary Questions; communicating via written correspondence, and telephone services. We fulfil the department’s responsibility for democratic accountability, through Ministers’ responses to MPs, and the department’s interaction with the public.


In the DfE Customer Analysis, Research and Briefing Team, we are dedicated to turning data analysis into customer intelligence to improve our channels options and user journeys in ‘real time.’ To do this we work in tandem with our partners in the digital communications team who aim to make it simpler, clearer, and easier to find online content, by managing and creating engaging web content on GOV.UK and integrating this with wider digital communications. We also manage the department’s briefing system – Find Answers to Enquiries – that is used to answer customer enquiries and the Contact-Us form completed by customers to submit enquiries.


We are looking to recruit and develop a data science apprentice to help deliver against our challenging targets. The Data Science field spans maths, statistics, software engineering and communications. Data Scientists blend experience and knowledge from a wide range of fields and organisations, and continuously seek to expand their range of technical skills, finding information in diverse datasets to address complex problems and improve organisational processes. Throughout the apprenticeship we will provide support to enable the successful candidate to develop skills in Google Analytics, Power BI, Excel, R statistical packages and using SQL to query ad-hoc data sources. Alongside data manipulation and interrogation experience, you will develop the ability to understand and identify the needs of users, as well as map their journeys through content. You will also develop superb analytical skills and become competent and confident in using data and evidence to create compelling and persuasive arguments.


The successful candidate will be a collaborative team-worker with excellent diplomacy, who is able to understand the high-level needs of colleagues across the department and translate digital data analysis into customer intelligence and insight.


You will be comfortable working independently as well as within a team and have the drive and intuition to identify key improvement projects – bringing high-level benefits to the division and the department, with a passion for accuracy, and a proven track record of positive outcomes.


Using these skills, you will build relationships and work in partnership with teams across the department, using data and intelligence to improve the department’s content on GOV.UK, bringing about tangible benefits to our users.


Duties and Responsibilities


Support the production of the central business as usual (BAU) ‘information reports’ using a combination of Google Analytics, Power BI, Excel, and R Coding skills.


Understand and act on customer requirements needed to produce new reports and Power BI dashboards from scratch and provide advice and guidance enabling customers to interpret their data.


Become an expert on Management Information and be able clearly and confidently share your knowledge with others.


Support the operation of the Find Answers to Enquiries briefing system and the Contact-Us form.


Apprenticeship

This is an exciting opportunity to earn as you learn and get hands on practice as a Data Scientist while you study towards a Level 6 qualification. You’ll receive formal learning to develop crucial skills, knowledge and behaviours for your career and be part of a great team delivering services to our customers. If you wish to find out more about the Data Science Degree Apprenticeship, click here: https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/data-scientist-integrated-degree/.


You will benefit from an initial induction event in a London college campus and will also attend immersive bootcamps delivered by our chosen training provider, where you will get the opportunity to develop core skills fundamental to the role and be fully supported by experienced technical coaches throughout, who will guide you to produce a portfolio of work demonstrating your learning.


You will be given sufficient time to allow you to complete your apprenticeship within your working hours, and you’ll be supported by your line manager, skills coach and the community, as well as fellow apprentices on the programme, so you will have plenty of sources of encouragement to help you succeed. Some study and travel outside normal working hours will also be required on occasion. There’s a lot to learn and do, so you need to be ready to be proactive, work hard and participate in the many opportunities you’ll be given to showcase your skills.


We anticipate that the successful candidate will take up the post on 26 September 2022.


The apprenticeship induction will take place during w/c 3 October 2022 with one day in London and the remainder of the week taking place on-line.

Moonpig.com,4.5,Data Scientist,"London, England","Our Ways of Working:
We believe that we do our best work when we are together, but also appreciate that everyone works in different ways. That’s why we operate with three working models which look to define where and how our people work - Remote, Hybrid, Site/Office - based.
Although we believe the majority of our people will choose our hybrid working model (at least 2 days in the office each week), for some of our teams that don't require as much in-person connection and collaboration, we offer fully remote working (with paid travel to the Moonpig office up to 6 times per year). Remote roles are specified directly on our job adverts
At Moonpig Group our mission is to help people connect and create moments that matter. We’re an international group made up of three brilliant brands – Moonpig in the UK, Ireland, US and Australia, and Greetz in the Netherlands – with our newest addition Buyagift joining us in 2022.
We were founded with a goal to disrupt the traditional greetings industry. Two decades on, we’re an established leader within the online gifting market, offering a wide range of products to customers across the world.
Moonpig is an iconic brand and innovator, with clear values (read more about our values here!). These values set our teams and our business up for success in an environment that’s fun, supportive and challenging. They’re the glue that binds us together and we think of them as a platform to help us deliver our best work. You have every chance to drive impact here at Moonpig, and most importantly, we genuinely want you!
We’re now growing the team to work towards an even more ambitious goal of reaching 25 million customers. To help get us there, we have some exciting innovations happening in our tech space and are looking for a Data Scientist to work with our Data Science team based in London.
Who You’ll Be Working With
Data Science is becoming an increasingly important value driver across the business. As such, you’ll have the chance to work with a diverse range of stakeholders and business functions. This could be anything from finance, to product, to marketing; we add value wherever we can!
Because the Data Science team is small, we have a significant breadth and depth of opportunity as a team. This means that no matter which function a project is for, you can be sure that it leads to a tangible impact.

What You’ll Be Doing
Clearly, a wide range of stakeholders ladders up to a wide range of projects. Such projects could provide opportunities to test and develop skills across forecasting, NLP, predictive modelling, clustering, causal inference, and many more classes of project.
No matter what the project, you will have the opportunity to take a leading role in its delivery. From scoping the project with the relevant business leads to ensuring the solution is fit for purpose and achievable. You'll be responsible for delivering the project and ensuring a consistent experience for our end-user, and through each step, evangelizing and communicating.
What You’ll Bring to the Role
2+ years’ experience in Data-Science with practical application within several of the following: Predictive modelling, clustering, NLP, photoscience, recommendations, dimensionality reduction & feature engineering, model deployment, forecasting, causal inference.
Excellent skills within either Python or R and SQL skills (so you can self-serve your own data).
Excellent stakeholder management.
Create a compelling narrative throughout the project lifecycle.
Strong commercial acumen - we want someone who can understand stakeholders needs/reservations and present accommodating solutions.
Nice to Have
Experience of working in a fast-paced eCommerce or Retail environment
Experience of AB and MVT experimentation, in particular building roadmaps and test design
Graduate degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, or related technical field
Experience using AWS ML deployment infrastructure; Apache Airflow or Sagemaker
Want to hear more?
Take a look at our Moonpig Attraction Deck where you can hear more about our awesome perks and benefits as well as a culture to boot.

Moonpig’s Commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity
At Moonpig Group, we’re committed to creating an inclusive and caring culture with brilliant people who feel a real sense of belonging. We welcome and celebrate all diverse backgrounds to Moonpig, from working parents who need flexibility with their hours to individuals who are neurodiverse and prefer to work a certain way.
We’re proud to have several employee-led committees within our organisation, including the LGBTQ+ Committee, The Gender Balance Comimittee and our Moonpig Against Racism Committee.
We’ll continue to push for diversity and that sense of belonging so that all Moonpig employees feel safe and comfortable to be their true authentic self at work. Our Ways of Working:
