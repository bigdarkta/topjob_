Security Assurance (SA) organization ensures JPMC's most systemic security risks are identified, understood, reported, and clearly connected to our existing controls, new business initiatives and the evolving technology landscape. Through continuous data gathering and technical assessments, identify and measure systemic risk across the firm to drive control uplift requirements where needed and ensure secure architectural patterns are useable, modern and implemented.


Controls Threat Assessments (CTA) team is an integral part of the SA organization. CTA team partners with Blue team, Threat Intelligence and product/engineering teams to develop and run a program to continuously test firm's defensive controls based on prioritized threats to the company. Results from CTA exercise help in enhancement, maintenance and governance of firm's defense controls.


Offensive Security Specialist:


As a Offensive Security Specialist within the CTA team, you will be hands-on in conducting threat-driven assessments for JPMC's technical controls to objectively measure our ability to prevent and detect consequential attack patterns. You will partner with the Blue team, Cyber Intelligence, Threat Modeling, Breach and Attack Simulation teams to understand our attack surface, coverage of controls, monitoring rules and use prioritized TTPs to systematically test controls against real-world threat actor techniques. This team requires thinking like an attacker while understanding the various capabilities and limitations of defensive technologies. The CTA team does not perform red teaming, blue teaming, threat hunting, penetration testing or vulnerability assessments but uses similar tools and techniques to evaluate the efficacy of controls against prioritized threats. You will be working with some of the best experts in the industry and faced with complex problem-solving opportunities, causing you to develop new skills as you progress through your career.


Responsibilities:

Test key threat scenarios against the firm's defense system using prioritized adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Procedures.
Define the attack surface and map controls that help defend it
Work closely with Cyber Operations to perform deep-dive technical controls effectiveness testing using both manual and automated means
Partner with the Breach and Attack Simulation team to create new actions/sequences/monitors to test controls, identify where a control cannot be tested due to context, environment issues, tooling limitations etc, write new bespoke actions based on research into new techniques
Work with product security and other security partners to align remediation efforts that best protect the firm
Collaborate with product and engineering teams to feed evidence for tracking/visualization, help mature products based on testing outcomes and industry advances
Develop, maintain and improve documentation and processes to ensure robust resilience and auditability

Requirements:

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Information Technology related field
Minimum 7 years of relevant work experience
Solid experience working in offensive/defensive security teams like Pentest, Redteam or Blue team
Foundational knowledge of cybersecurity organization practices, operations, risk management processes, principles, architectural requirements, engineering and threats and vulnerabilities
Ability to collaborate with high-performing Agile teams and individuals throughout the firm to accomplish goals
Ability to analyze vulnerabilities, threats, designs, procedures and architectural design, producing reports and sharing intelligence
Thorough knowledge of network protocols
Good understanding of security architecture and controls
Solid understanding of MITRE ATT&CK framework
