Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

COVID-19 Considerations
We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.
In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.
Corporate Security Responsibility
All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must:
Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines. Our Purpose

Responsibilities
What we build:
We build innovative security and data compliance products. Our security products are brought together in the Microsoft 365 Defender (M365D) suite. M365D enables Microsoft’s enterprise customers to detect, investigate, understand, and respond to advanced threats on their networks via a combination of behavioral sensors, cloud security analytics, and threat intelligence.
The Microsoft Threat Experts Team is looking for threat hunters! No matter how sophisticated attacker behaviors become, Microsoft 365 Defender (M365D) will help enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks and data breaches on their networks. Our team uses deep knowledge of the attacker landscape and rich telemetry from our sensors to perform root-cause analysis and generate custom alerts, ensuring that M365D customers are well equipped to quickly respond to human adversaries identified in their unique environments.
Ensuring that no human adversary can operate silently begins with experts harnessing the powerful optics provided by M365D, across the attacker kill-chain, coupled with world-class detections. We’re looking for a skilled hunter to harness the power of Microsoft’s trillions of security signals to quickly identify and report the latest human adversary behaviors, drive critical context-rich alerts, build new tools and automations in support of hunting objectives, and drive innovations for detecting advanced attacker tradecraft.
Primary responsibilities would include:
Explore and correlate large data sets to uncover novel attack techniques, monitor and catalog changes in activity group tradecraft, to research and provide new detection mechanisms.
Acquire new and leverage existing knowledge of attacker tools, tactics and procedures to improve security posture of customers.
Self-driven and team cooperated research on novel attack techniques to simulate them in lab on endpoints and cloud infrastructure to identify required detection mechanisms.
Identify need of required tools for research and analysis and effectively engage and collaborate with partners in engineering and data science to develop and maintain them.
Effectively engage and collaborate with partners in data science, threat research to develop and maintain high-fidelity detection rules.
Build hunting tools and automations for use in the discovery of human adversaries.
You would be expected to support a 24/7 operation model that may sometimes involve working in night shifts.
Qualifications
5+ years of experience in a technical role in the areas of Security Operations, Malware analysis, Threat Intelligence, Cyber Incident Response, or Penetration Testing/Red Team
Comfortable working with extremely large data sets for analysis and visualization, using tools and scripting languages such as: Excel, SQL, Python, Splunk Query Language, Kusto query language and PowerBI
Ability to track, analyze, and brief on new and ongoing cyber-attacks in cloud infrastructure with understanding on AAD, ADFS and popular authentication/authorization protocols like SAML, OAUTH, OpenID connect
In-depth understanding of latest cloud-based techniques used by attackers for persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion and lateral movement in platforms such as Azure AD, Office 365 and Google Workspace
Functional understanding of common threat analysis models such as the Diamond Model, Cyber Kill Chain, and MITRE ATT&CK.
Advanced experience using analysis tools (e.g. file/network/OS monitoring tools and/or debuggers) and advanced knowledge of operating system internals and security mechanisms
Excellent cross-group and interpersonal skills, with the ability to articulate business need for detection improvements and strong ability to use data to ‘tell a story’.
Following additional experiences are favorable, but not required:
Technical BS degree preferred in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Security, Mathematics, or Physics
Experience with system administration in a large enterprise environment including Windows and Linux servers, along with workstations, network and cloud administration. For example, expertise in EDR (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint), MDO, MDI, MCAS, MTP or M365D
