Offering a comprehensive portfolio of managed security services, consulting and professional services, and data protection technology, Trustwave helps businesses embrace digital transformation securely. For more information about Trustwave, visit https://www.trustwave.com.
$5k and 5 days’ training / continued education allowance per year
Career growth - receive mentoring, coaching, and support to progress your career
Flexible work arrangements and a supportive team (you'll never feel alone!)
Everyone's voice matters here. We aren’t looking for passengers, we’re looking for those interested in an opportunity to develop their skills and experience in information security and make a real difference.
In short, to work here, you need to give a s*** - after all, it could be your data you're protecting.
In return for your commitment, we will develop you personally and professionally in the company of competent colleagues, and you will have a professional development budget at your disposal each year for just that. We also want to recognise and reward your ongoing efforts and have a range of ways of doing that, from an annual bonus, flexible work arrangements, to cake ceremonies (we love cake) or a special night out. But best of all, we’ll give you a hoodie and are happy for you to dress casually when working in the office.
Please note, due to client requirements, it is mandatory you hold a security clearance or be willing / eligible to obtain a BASELINE clearance (this includes being an Australian citizen).
A bit more about the role
Trustwave is seeking a Security Advisor Graduate (GRC / Cyber) who we can train/mentor/coach to provide a broad range of advisory services, covering security strategy, governance, risk, audit and compliance topics, as well as possessing enough of a technical background to be able to confidently work within high-complexity environments.
Your day to day tasks will vary considerably – from helping deliver client projects, working with clients / prospective clients and identifying their security needs and more. Typical delivery tasks might include:
Undertaking security threat and risk assessments
Developing security strategies and roadmaps
Developing and reviewing solution / capability design artefacts
Developing and refining policies, standards, principles and strategies, and assessing their effectiveness
Assisting in the evaluation of emerging technologies, service providers, tools, platforms and applications that are best suited to the specific needs of a given organisation
Delivering security architecture advice (particularly surrounding cloud services)
A bit more about you
You’ll have:
Top-notch written and verbal communication skills
An analytical mindset (particularly when it comes to technology and business risk)
An ability to deliver consulting projects at a high quality, often under pressure, while also developing strong relationships with our customers
Strong passion or interest in cybersecurity or governance/risk/compliance
Education:
Generally though, certifications /qualifications are nice to have. What we care about is what you know, and who you are. How you came to know it – whether via formal education, industry training and certification, self study, or the school of hard knocks -will be a good discussion point, but we don't necessarily favor one over the other.

But most of all, you must be passionate about sharing your information security knowledge with everyone around you, particularly your clients, your colleagues and the broader infosec industry – you want to make a change for the better.
At Trustwave, everyone's experience is valued. We advocate Diversity of Thought, using diversity of experiences and perspectives to innovate and solve real world problems. Our people have studied at different universities, are self-taught, have worked in different companies in Australia, and around the world. Whoever you are, be comfortable, be different, be you, with us. Join Trustwave and together we’ll solve the cybersecurity challenges of today and into the future.

Fujitsu complies with government legislation in various jurisdictions which in certain circumstances may impose a requirement that certain workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 (or otherwise have a valid exemption). Also, for client facing roles, many of our customers require our staff to be vaccinated to attend their workplaces. Based on Fujitsu’s assessment of workplace risk and the safety and wellbeing of our people and consultation with our staff, Fujitsu has introduced a Vaccination Requirements policy which requires all persons entering a Fujitsu workplace, attending a Fujitsu work-related event, or entering other premises to undertake work on Fujitsu’s behalf to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or the subject of an appropriate exemption (and to provide evidence of the same). Consequently as a result of Fujitsu’s policy, and, where applicable , customer and legislated vaccination requirements, Fujitsu requires all new employees to be fully vaccinated or have an authorised exemption approved by Fujitsu’s Crisis management Team (CMT). Recruits will be required to provide evidence of their vaccination status as part of the recruitment process. Location:

Fujitsu complies with government legislation in various jurisdictions which in certain circumstances may impose a requirement that certain workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 (or otherwise have a valid exemption). Also, for client facing roles, many of our customers require our staff to be vaccinated to attend their workplaces. Based on Fujitsu’s assessment of workplace risk and the safety and wellbeing of our people and consultation with our staff, Fujitsu has introduced a Vaccination Requirements policy which requires all persons entering a Fujitsu workplace, attending a Fujitsu work-related event, or entering other premises to undertake work on Fujitsu’s behalf to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or the subject of an appropriate exemption (and to provide evidence of the same). Consequently as a result of Fujitsu’s policy, and, where applicable , customer and legislated vaccination requirements, Fujitsu requires all new employees to be fully vaccinated or have an authorised exemption approved by Fujitsu’s Crisis management Team (CMT). Recruits will be required to provide evidence of their vaccination status as part of the recruitment process.  Location:
