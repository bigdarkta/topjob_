Job description
Your opportunity
To make a positive impact that matters by helping our firm to protect the terabytes of data it manages and enable it to deliver new technologies securely.
Do you have a naturally inquisitive mind? Do you enjoy working through complex challenges, and do you have an interest in cyber risk and security and want to learn more? Then this is the role for you. We are looking for an Assistant Manager to join our second line of defense cyber risk team. You will be helping the team manage the complex cyber risks Deloitte face daily, and you’ll be able to make an impact that matters and drive positive security change.
We are proud to offer flexible working arrangements which allow our people to choose the most suitable working arrangement that works for them. Whether this is working 4 days per week, taking the summer months off work, or more flexibility around your working pattern, we consider both formal and informal working arrangements that allow our people and our clients the best outcome.
If you would like to hear more about our flexible working arrangements, please let us know.
Are you looking to return to the workplace after an extended career break?
For this role we can offer coaching and support designed for returners to refresh your knowledge and skills and help your transition back into the workplace after a career break of 2 years or more. If this is relevant for you, just let your recruiter know when you make your application.
Your role
Our Cyber Risk team has a large catalogue of services we provide to the business which ranges from consultancy on large firm-wide projects, governance, assurance & cyber risk management to information protection, cyber incident support, threat intelligence. We are looking for an Assistant Manager to help support and expand the existing team, help us assess risks to the firm, deliver our second line assurance program, and support our management of third-party cyber risks. The cyber risk landscape changes constantly and we support a large and varied business that is constantly evolving and growing, so no two days are ever quite the same here and your role will grow and evolve over time.
Spend time learning about and understanding the 3 line of defence model, our second line Cyber Risk services and support awareness, consultancy and delivery of the services across the business
Build and maintain relationships, grow your internal network and help provide Cyber Risk subject matter expertise to the wider Deloitte community, identifying and proactively improving key stakeholder relationships
Support our second line assurance plan as it builds out into a rolling calendar of work and help us to review and effectively assess risk
Keep up with new technologies in use in the market and within our business and use that knowledge to help us find emerging cyber risks
Work effectively in diverse teams within an inclusive team culture where people are recognised for their contribution
Your work, your choice
At Deloitte we believe the best impact is the value we add, not the hours we sit at our desk. We carefully consider agile ways of working, both formal and informal, that allow for the best impact for our people and our clients. Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you.
Location: You will have a regional office aligned based on your location, but with the option to work remotely from home and flexibly too. We are happy for you to work remotely the majority of the time if desired as long as you’re happy to travel to London/Cardiff to collaborate with teams occasionally.

Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation.
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what we’re looking for:
We live our purpose: we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognising others for the impact they make
We develop talent: we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities
We drive performance: we deliver exceptional client service; maximise results and drive high performance from people while fostering collaboration across businesses and borders
We believe positive influence can make an impact that matters: we influence clients, teams, and individuals positively, leading by example and establishing confident relationships with increasingly senior people
We move, together, towards a strategic direction: we understand key objectives for clients and Deloitte, aligning people to objectives and setting priorities and direction.

To make a positive impact that matters by helping our firm to protect the terabytes of data it manages and enable it to deliver new technologies securely.
Do you have a naturally inquisitive mind? Do you enjoy working through complex challenges, and do you have an interest in cyber risk and security and want to learn more? Then this is the role for you. We are looking for an Assistant Manager to join our second line of defense cyber risk team.

Are you looking to return to the workplace after an extended career break?
For this role we can offer coaching and support designed for returners to refresh your knowledge and skills and help your transition back into the workplace after a career break of 2 years or more. If this is relevant for you, just let your recruiter know when you make your application.

Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you.
Location: You will have a regional office aligned based on your location, but with the option to work remotely from home and flexibly too.

About the job
Summary
Can you help to protect the UK from emerging cyber threats?
Are you interested in using your skills on classified projects you cannot work on anywhere else?
Do you want to be part of a team that conducts cutting edge science and engineering?
The military and civilian worlds are entirely dependent on electronic systems and data. This affects everything from our everyday phones and laptops through to our military vehicles, power distribution, communications systems, and other 'invisible' systems.
Dstl’s cyber capability protecting UK Defence and Security from the cyber threats to our systems, networks and military platforms.
It’s not the stuff that we can say about our work that makes it exciting... it's the stuff we can't!
Dstl recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion as people from diverse backgrounds bring fresh ideas. We are committed to building an inclusive working environment in which each employee fulfils their potential and maximises their contribution.
We particularly welcome female and ethnic minority applicants and those from the LGBTQI community, as they are under-represented within Dstl at these levels.
Job description
We need a diverse range of people with creative minds who can bring individual perspectives to our classified challenges.
We work across software, electronics, RF, hardware, security and safety critical systems to:
Invent and develop novel cyber tools, techniques and capabilities.
Research current and future novel technologies in the cyber domain.
Analyse the vulnerabilities in cyber technologies - how they work and how to break them! Understanding how they can be broken is critical to building appropriate protections for them.
Develop proofs of concept that can become assured solutions.
Steward and support the continued evolution of trustworthy technologies and solutions for our military networks and systems
Provide through-life security, safety and cyber resilience for software-intensive products, systems and services.
Advise on, create and support UK MOD cyber policy, certification, regulations and guidance.
We use our cyber expertise in everything from security, safety and autonomous systems through to hardware, antennae and large complex software to deliver solutions that afford the UK global strategic advantage. .
If you want to work with unique capabilities, facilities and colleagues to protect the UK through supporting current and future cyber operations then Dstl’s Cyber and Information Systems Division is the place for you.
For more information on the Cyber roles, please see attached below.
Responsibilities
We are looking for individuals who can think systematically, logically, and creatively. You will have a natural desire to understand how and why systems function as they do.
You should be able to demonstrate an aptitude and appetite for complex problem solving and communicate effectively.
You will have a clear passion for science, engineering and technology coupled with the desire to ensure that the UK Armed Forces have the best information, security and equipment possible.
There are no mandatory qualifications or certifications needed for our hands-on cyber roles.
If you have a passion for technology and want a career that makes a positive difference to the Defence and Security of the UK then these roles could be right for you. Even if you are unsure that you meet all of the criteria, you may well have skills or a mind-set that we need!

We value every colleague, their diversity and the contribution that they make. When we say you’re welcome at BT, we really mean it.
Secondly, the one thing the pandemic has taught us is that a lot of current and future colleagues, where and when possible, want to embrace hybrid working. Therefore, we are introducing Smart Working at BT. Smart Working means having the flexibility to choose, as a team, how and where you work depending on your team’s deliverables and needs; when you are at your shared core location to connect with others and when not. It may not be for every role, and, as part of the recruitment process, you’ll have the chance to discuss Smart Working and how it might work for the job you are applying for.
Security isn’t always the first thing that people think of with BT, but it is one of the fastest growing parts of our global organisation. We protect our networks from more than 6,500 cyber-attacks each day, invest over £40m in research each year and employ more than 3,000 people - which makes us the largest private cyber security employer in the UK. With incredible opportunities to learn, develop and grow your skills, we’ll invest in you, nurture potential and shape your future – whatever your background or experience. You can find out more about Security in BT here
In today’s world, safe and secure digital connections have never been more vital. You’ll be joining a global company operating at the forefront of the information age: BT employs 90,000 people in 180 countries. With huge scale, we’re capable of achieving great things, striving to be personal, simple, and brilliant for our customers whilst creating an inclusive working environment where people from all backgrounds can succeed. Play your part. Make a difference. We are the Protectors.

About BT
There are two things that we want to share with anyone considering joining us.
Firstly, we’ve got big ambitions for our colleagues and the future of the organisation. These include our vision that inclusion and accessibility drive every conversation we have and every decision we make. We want our workforce to fully represent the communities and customers we serve, because a diverse business is a better business. We value every colleague, their diversity and the contribution that they make. When we say you’re welcome at BT, we really mean it.
Secondly, the one thing the pandemic has taught us is that a lot of current and future colleagues, where and when possible, want to embrace hybrid working. Therefore, we are introducing Smart Working at BT. Smart Working means having the flexibility to choose, as a team, how and where you work depending on your team’s deliverables and needs; when you are at your shared core location to connect with others and when not.

THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF 809 CONNECTED BUSINESSES

Digital and Innovation in Westminster City Council is a world of extraordinary stories, where creative and enterprising people put local residents and businesses first.

Today, Westminster is the most connected borough in London. But, when David joined us in the mid-2010s, small businesses were still struggling to get connected to fibre. Without gigabit-capable broadband, some companies even resorted to biking memory sticks around the city, simply to share files with clients.

Although still in a junior role, David took the initiative and successfully made the business case for £2.8 million of European funding to support connectivity for small businesses across Westminster. Feedback from businesses has been overwhelmingly positive as the project has enhanced their communications with clients. The new connectivity allows them to make video calls and work remotely. As the pandemic hit and many more people needed to work from home, it became clear just how vital this investment had been.

Fast-forward a few years. Westminster is leading the way for connectivity, as a result of the project businesses are thriving and David is heading up a service of his own responsible for delivery of the smart city strategy.

The Role:

As Cyber Security Officer, you can make your own powerful contribution to ensuring our status as a leading Digital Local Authority. Working across the whole of the Digital and Innovation portfolio, but specialising in Cyber Security, you’ll be part of major changes in both the digital landscape and the culture of our organisation.
Regularly monitoring system usage and security, you’ll respond to potential security incidents and recommend effective countermeasures to reduce future risk. You will also respond to enquiries by users and other parties, and carry out administration for a range of critical systems including antivirus and anti-spam management. We’ll expect you to keep
up to date with emerging cyber threats.
Please refer to the Job Description for more information.

About You:

With a background in IT, you’re likely to have experience of using network or internet audit and monitoring tools. Knowledge of security issues relating to hardware and software in the Microsoft technology stack is essential. You’ll also be aware of ISO27001 and other information security best practice standards, including cloud security and storage area network security.

What We Offer:

Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride.

We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities.

At Westminster City Council, we are passionate about our aim to be an inclusive workplace for all that reflects the communities we serve, and we believe everyone is valued. We particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, including B.A.ME, Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ and those with hidden or visible disabilities. We’re committed to ensuring all our staff – regardless of gender, age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity or disability – can succeed. We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way. About Us:

Fast-forward a few years. Westminster is leading the way for connectivity, as a result of the project businesses are thriving and David is heading up a service of his own responsible for delivery of the smart city strategy.

The Role:

As Cyber Security Officer, you can make your own powerful contribution to ensuring our status as a leading Digital Local Authority. Working across the whole of the Digital and Innovation portfolio, but specialising in Cyber Security, you’ll be part of major changes in both the digital landscape and the culture of our organisation.
Regularly monitoring system usage and security, you’ll respond to potential security incidents and recommend effective countermeasures to reduce future risk. You will also respond to enquiries by users and other parties, and carry out administration for a range of critical systems including antivirus and anti-spam management. We’ll expect you to keep
up to date with emerging cyber threats.
Please refer to the Job Description for more information.

About You:

With a background in IT, you’re likely to have experience of using network or internet audit and monitoring tools. Knowledge of security issues relating to hardware and software in the Microsoft technology stack is essential. You’ll also be aware of ISO27001 and other information security best practice standards, including cloud security and storage area network security.

What We Offer:

Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride.

We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities.

We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way. About Us:

THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF 809 CONNECTED BUSINESSES

Digital and Innovation in Westminster City Council is a world of extraordinary stories, where creative and enterprising people put local residents and businesses first.

Today, Westminster is the most connected borough in London. But, when David joined us in the mid-2010s, small businesses were still struggling to get connected to fibre. Without gigabit-capable broadband, some companies even resorted to biking memory sticks around the city, simply to share files with clients.

Although still in a junior role, David took the initiative and successfully made the business case for £2.8 million of European funding to support connectivity for small businesses across Westminster. Feedback from businesses has been overwhelmingly positive as the project has enhanced their communications with clients. The new connectivity allows them to make video calls and work remotely. As the pandemic hit and many more people needed to work from home, it became clear just how vital this investment had been.

The Post Office has thrived at the heart of high streets and local communities across the UK for over 370 years. As one of the country’s most trusted brands, we take our commitment to providing essential services to customers across the UK very seriously. We’re the UK’s largest retail network, as well as the largest financial services provider in the UK, with over 11,600 branches nationwide – more than all of the UK’s banks and building societies put together.

We know that the best way to provide a great service for customers is to evolve our business and adapt to their changing needs. That’s why we have a range of over 170 products and services, from personal financial services like banking, insurance, payments and travel money, to telecoms and, of course, mails. And we’re improving our online and in store experience for customers. We know that our customers never stop changing, so neither will we.

Securing the future Post Office’s future:
We are working hard to ensure that the next chapter of the Post Office’s history is a bright one. We are the current guardians of an iconic business and we want to hand over a thriving network of branches which can continue to provide essential products and services for our customers for many years to come. This is a uniquely exciting and challenging time for the Post Office – we’re shaping the future and creating a business we can all be proud of.

Working at the Post Office:
Post Office colleagues are the driving force behind our business. Whether they are in our branches or supporting from our offices, we are proud of the energy, commitment and customer focus our people all have in common.

All Post Office people are guided by our three values and behaviours:
We care by always thinking customer

Cyber Security Service Manager

Salary: Circa £35,000 per annum depending on experience

Contract: Permanent

Location: Hybrid - office based with full flexibility to work from home or at any of our main hubs – London, Bristol, Manchester and Harwell.


Jisc is the UK higher, further education and skills sectors’ not-for-profit organisation for digital services and solutions. We operate shared digital infrastructure and services; negotiate sector-wide deals with IT vendors and commercial publishers; and provide trusted advice and practical assistance for universities, colleges and learning providers.


We believe in technology for good – in improving lives through education and research. Our people want to make a real change and are at the heart of our success. At Jisc, everyone plays a key role and gets the chance to feel part of it, that to us is the definition of a meaningful career.


We’re a place unlike any other, where the best of education fuses with the best of technology to create a unique model with unique opportunities and interesting problems to solve in a diverse and inclusive environment. It’s what keeps our work varied, original and surprising – and that’s why we love it.


Our story will be written by those ready to take on challenges and see them through; the kind of people who never stop learning, celebrating differences and using it to drive better solutions. You can look forward to a rewarding job with opportunities to develop and make a real difference to the education and research sectors.


The team:

This role is in the Cyber security division which provides cyber security services to our members and customers, ensuring that our capabilities and expertise are applied cost-effectively and imaginatively.


About the role:

This role will be responsible for the daily service management activities of the Managed SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) service and ensure it is delivered to meet or exceed requirements, working closely with other teams supporting the service. Launched two years ago this was the first managed cyber service launched by Jisc, with several other managed services to come.


This position is playing a critical role in the successful roll-out of the next phase of the service, leading the way in delivering services to help protect the UK’s further and higher education organisations from cyber threats.


Other responsibilities will include:

Manage the provision of the service and maintain the agreed levels of performance
Develop excellent working relationships with key internal teams and stakeholders to ensure successful delivery of the service
Lead on and conduct regular service reviews with customers
Act as a point of contact for service enquiries
Assist in projects for implementing enhancements to the service


About you:

We know that sometimes people can be put off applying for a job if they think they can’t tick every box but we realise the ‘perfect candidate’ doesn’t exist. So, if you can do most of what we’re looking for, go ahead and apply. You could be exactly what we need!


We are looking for:

Experience of working in a service management environment and/or customer service role
Experience of working in a cyber security environment would be advantageous
High-level understanding of security concepts and applications
Capability to communicate concisely and effectively equally well with technical, non-technical colleagues and with members and/or customers alike
Strong customer service focus


Why work at Jisc:

We want to make sure our people have the flexibility they need to balance their personal lives and do well at work. So, we focus on outputs rather than presenteeism and are open to a whole range of ways of working.


We offer hybrid working although a majority of our staff work from home. To keep close to our team and other colleagues, we chat and collaborate effectively online via Teams and other channels. All our offices are open if you prefer that kind of environment, and occasionally we will have an ‘office day’ just to catch up and get some face time with each other. A few of our roles require you to be in the office more regularly, but this will be discussed at interview.


You can look forward to a rewarding job with opportunities to develop and make a real difference to the education and research sectors. We’re always learning and developing, and all our people have access to a huge variety of learning resources to help them achieve this.


Our benefits are great too. We offer:

Flexible work pattern, which can adapt to suit your schedules and personal commitments
28 days holidays per annum plus bank holidays. You will also get an additional 3 days paid leave between Christmas and New Year
A generous pension scheme with above average employer contributions.
A range of leave options, including parental leave, volunteer leave and even career breaks.
A generous budget to attend conferences and in-person training
Allocated allowance of up to £250 to equip your home office
A company culture which supports and promotes personal learning and development, including access to thousands of courses on LinkedIn Learning.
Mental health first aid trained staff and supportive environment, plus your own Wellbeing allowance to spend on wellbeing for you
Financial well-being support.
Discounts on big-name high-street stores.
Cycle to work scheme.
Employee recognition awards and travel loans.


Connecting with each other is easy, thanks to our technology but getting face to face is something we value and find time for when we can. Our main offices are Bristol, London, Harwell and Manchester, so you may need to travel on occasion.


Other stuff you need to know

At Jisc we celebrate diversity and know that it is critical for our success. We work hard to make sure we’re inclusive. So, if you are great at what you do and share our values, we want to hear from you.


If you need any adjustments made to the application or selection process so you can do your best, let us know. We will be happy to help.


Just so you know, we review CVs as we receive them, and interview as soon as we have applications that look like a good match (usually within a week). We don’t use closing dates. So, please apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on this role. We advertised this role on 08/08/2022.

The team:

This role is in the Cyber security division which provides cyber security services to our members and customers, ensuring that our capabilities and expertise are applied cost-effectively and imaginatively.


About the role:

This role will be responsible for the daily service management activities of the Managed SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) service and ensure it is delivered to meet or exceed requirements, working closely with other teams supporting the service. Launched two years ago this was the first managed cyber service launched by Jisc, with several other managed services to come.


This position is playing a critical role in the successful roll-out of the next phase of the service, leading the way in delivering services to help protect the UK’s further and higher education organisations from cyber threats.


Other responsibilities will include:

Manage the provision of the service and maintain the agreed levels of performance
Develop excellent working relationships with key internal teams and stakeholders to ensure successful delivery of the service
Lead on and conduct regular service reviews with customers
Act as a point of contact for service enquiries
Assist in projects for implementing enhancements to the service


About you:

We know that sometimes people can be put off applying for a job if they think they can’t tick every box but we realise the ‘perfect candidate’ doesn’t exist. So, if you can do most of what we’re looking for, go ahead and apply. You could be exactly what we need!


We are looking for:

Experience of working in a service management environment and/or customer service role
Experience of working in a cyber security environment would be advantageous
High-level understanding of security concepts and applications
Capability to communicate concisely and effectively equally well with technical, non-technical colleagues and with members and/or customers alike
Strong customer service focus


Why work at Jisc:

We want to make sure our people have the flexibility they need to balance their personal lives and do well at work. So, we focus on outputs rather than presenteeism and are open to a whole range of ways of working.


We offer hybrid working although a majority of our staff work from home. To keep close to our team and other colleagues, we chat and collaborate effectively online via Teams and other channels. All our offices are open if you prefer that kind of environment, and occasionally we will have an ‘office day’ just to catch up and get some face time with each other. A few of our roles require you to be in the office more regularly, but this will be discussed at interview.


You can look forward to a rewarding job with opportunities to develop and make a real difference to the education and research sectors. We’re always learning and developing, and all our people have access to a huge variety of learning resources to help them achieve this.


Our benefits are great too. We offer:

Flexible work pattern, which can adapt to suit your schedules and personal commitments
28 days holidays per annum plus bank holidays. You will also get an additional 3 days paid leave between Christmas and New Year
A generous pension scheme with above average employer contributions.
A range of leave options, including parental leave, volunteer leave and even career breaks.
A generous budget to attend conferences and in-person training
Allocated allowance of up to £250 to equip your home office
A company culture which supports and promotes personal learning and development, including access to thousands of courses on LinkedIn Learning.
Mental health first aid trained staff and supportive environment, plus your own Wellbeing allowance to spend on wellbeing for you
Financial well-being support.
Discounts on big-name high-street stores.
Cycle to work scheme.
Employee recognition awards and travel loans.


Connecting with each other is easy, thanks to our technology but getting face to face is something we value and find time for when we can. Our main offices are Bristol, London, Harwell and Manchester, so you may need to travel on occasion.


Other stuff you need to know

At Jisc we celebrate diversity and know that it is critical for our success. We work hard to make sure we’re inclusive. So, if you are great at what you do and share our values, we want to hear from you.


If you need any adjustments made to the application or selection process so you can do your best, let us know. We will be happy to help.


Just so you know, we review CVs as we receive them, and interview as soon as we have applications that look like a good match (usually within a week). We don’t use closing dates. So, please apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on this role. We advertised this role on 08/08/2022. Job Ref

Your opportunity
Do you want to be at the heart of some of the biggest and most ambitious programmes undertaken to keep our country safe?
We are proud of the impact we have with our Defence & Security clients, the strength of our relationships, and the variety of our skills and expertise that we bring to help them achieve their mission.
We’re growing our teams across all of Consulting. If you are cleared to SC or DV level, or willing and eligible to obtain this, and want to grow your career in this sector, we are very keen to hear from you.
This role provides an opportunity to collaborate with the best talent by joining one of the leading Public Sector strategy teams in the market. Working in the Defence & Security team in Monitor Deloitte offers access to senior decision makers in some of the highest profile public sector organisations and an ability to solve their unique challenges that impact the defence and security of the UK. The role affords the opportunity for exceptional career experiences and growth within a supportive development environment. You will operate across the full span of strategy engagements including board level corporate strategy, organisational transformation and innovative commercial frameworks, working as part of a close-knit team passionate about making a difference through the impact Deloitte delivers to improve public sector organisations and outcomes.
Strategy, Analytics and M&A
How do you make intelligent, future-proof decisions in a world where change is the one constant? That’s exactly what you’ll help our clients to do. You’ll build trusted relationships with business stakeholders – and use the most exciting new technologies available – to create data-driven programmes that transform their organisations. Your advice will help clients position their organisations to succeed in an ever-evolving marketplace.
Your role
To grow with confidence, organisations need to make clear choices about where to play and how to win. In a world where the pace of change is rapid and sometimes unexpected, leaders need to act nimbly and decisively. Deloitte’s strategy consultants, known as Monitor Deloitte, employ cutting edge approaches embedded with deep industry expertise, working with leaders and empowered teams to make critical choices, and drive value.
Our Public Sector practice has a strong and growing presence in the Defence & Security industry. The strength of our relationships and the depth and breadth of our skills has put us at the heart of some of the biggest and most ambitious programmes undertaken in these industries. We are working with some of the largest and highest profile organisations, helping them to solve their most complex and challenging issues.
We are continuing to identify exciting new opportunities and new client challenges. To deliver on our significant growth plans we are looking for experienced consultants and industry experts to join us at Consultant and Senior Consultant level.
Strategic options analysis and evaluation: working with clients to understand and evaluate strategic options ahead of key investment decisions;
Designing strategic business models: helping clients identify the optimum business, organisational, or commercial models to more effectively deliver their objectives;
Commercial modelling: Analysis of the financial implications of different options, including development of scenarios and stress testing;
Strategic cost reduction: helping clients determine where, and how, to cut costs whilst seeking to enhance delivery and achieve policy outcomes;
Harnessing innovation: helping clients to stimulate innovation, adapt to strategic disruptions (e.g. technology – AI / robotics), and enable more effective policy delivery; and
Turning strategy into reality: Supporting clients to understand the required change, the challenges of implementation, and adjusting the strategy in response.
Generating analysis and insight: executing rigorous and insightful analysis to build an evidence base to support strategy development and change;
Tools, skills and frameworks: developing an understanding of effective tools, skills and frameworks that can be brought to bear on new client problems, deploying them appropriately and sharing as best practice within the team;
Team management: managing and supporting junior staff in order to ensure successful project delivery;
Relationship management: Working closely with clients and third parties (e.g. academics) to develop strong professional relationships;
Liaising with other internal teams (including our Digital Strategy, Innovation, Cyber Security and Data Analytics teams) to ensure the effective application of the subject matter expertise available, and a seamless client experience;
Continuous Learning: proactively developing your own skills, seeking feedback, building knowledge, and sharing your insight with colleagues; and
Supporting the management of the practice and successful business development.
Your work, your choice
At Deloitte we believe the best impact is the value we add, not the hours we sit at our desk. We carefully consider agile ways of working, both formal and informal, that allow for the best impact for our people and our clients. Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you.
Location: You will be based in a Deloitte London office, however travel will be required for client projects. Whilst some clients are London based, we do spend time on site with regional and international clients. We specify full mobility for our consulting roles but we make arrangements respectfully.
Work pattern: This is a permanent role with a degree of flexibility. We do encourage careful consideration of agile ways of working, both formal and informal arrangements that allow for the best outcomes for our people and our clients.

Demonstrable experience of managing stakeholder relationships
Ability to think creatively to solve client issues
Structured thinking and the ability to break down complex issues

Desirable:

Experience of complex commercial procurements in Defence, major capital projects, or analogous industries would be of significant interest
Your service line: Consulting
Our people and the way we work are the two things that set us apart in the consulting universe. For us, collaboration is fundamental to success, along with an unrivalled depth and breadth of expertise. We work closely with our clients and each other, at every stage of every project, solving our clients’ trickiest problems with a mix of knowledge, creativity and intellectual rigour. A hugely diverse range of clients rely on us to deliver the kind of change that adds genuine, lasting value to their business.
Personal independence
Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process.

These five shared values lead every decision we make and action we take, guiding us to deliver impact how and where it matters most.
Being a Leader at Deloitte
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation.
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what we’re looking for:
We live our purpose: we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognising others for the impact they make
We develop talent: we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities

As a Roke Graduate you can expect an exceptional platform to launch your career. With highly experienced, friendly and engaged colleagues who will support you each step of the way.
Your career chartered by you!
Graduates at Roke have access to a rich pool of varied opportunities. This could include developing deep specialist knowledge in a niche field. Broad knowledge across the tech stack. Domain expertise leading to more client-focused roles. Pastoral care and coaching via line management.
Your Learning and Development!
You’ll spend your first 6 weeks with your fellow graduate cohort on Roke’s bootcamp where you will sharpen your skills making sure you are fully prepared before joining your teams on live projects. A vast majority of the training we provide is carried out by engineers for engineers! Over the course of your first two years you will receive ongoing technical and soft skills training, developing your Roke portfolio which will support your salary reviews and career aspirations.
Roke are widely recognised as being among the best in their field therefore we have the foundations in place to ensure our Engineers develop the necessary skills to help solve our client’s toughest challenges.
Your Community!
Roke fosters a campus like feel on each of its sites, due in part to the relaxed dress code but more intrinsically by its people. We employ some of the best and brightest the world has to offer, but beyond that we employ people who are genuinely passionate about the technology they use and the work they do. Together this generates vibrant community of friendly individuals eager to support your development.
Roke prides itself on doing better each year on all aspects around the business and the community it serves. To aid in this we have Corporate Social Responsibility Groups (CSRGs) and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The CSRGs cover larger scale activates such as STEM outreach, Community outreach and Sustainability. ERGs are more specific, personal and focus on diversity & Inclusion.
A message from Roke’s Inspire - LGBT+ Support Network – “We provide support and advice, and champion inclusivity and understanding for anyone with questions around sexual orientation and gender identity. Membership is private and open to allies too”.
Roke also benefits from a plethora of employee-led clubs which cover everything from gaming to food. A few example clubs include Football, Climbing, Airsoft, Sailing, Cyber security, Data science, Astronomy, and much, much more!
Alongside this, there are numerous company events throughout the year, including a summer music festival, bonfire night (including fireworks, of course!) and a Christmas party.
Your Projects!
Unlike other working environments Roke maintains a project-orientated structure. This allows and encourages you to “try out” a variety of skills and roles throughout your career. You could finish an Artificial Intelligence Python project then move onto a Vison processing C++ project. You might also split your weeks with Bidding activities and running a small team. There’s a large amount of flexibility by design and it’s up to you how you engage with this feature. Finally, please note this isn’t a perk just for new starters but an intrinsic part of Roke. We routinely have senior engineers change projects to “try out something new” or juggle multiple projects because “they all sound fun!”
Your Application Process
Our hiring community will review your CV and supporting information from the application form. If we feel Roke would be a great fit for your aspirations you’ll be invited to an assessment centre.
Roke assessment days are both fun and challenging. You’ll meet the tech teams, receive a talk from a senior leader, receive a tour, have an interview and partake in super-fun, original team exercises. We will provide you with lunch and cover your travel expenses.
Roke encourage applications from neuro-diverse people. We are keen to arrange an alternative interview process and we will make reasonable adjustments. Just reach out to the Recruitment Team and we will work with you to develop a bespoke application process that is tailored to suit your needs.

Ultra Electronics,3.6,Security Researcher,"Farnborough, Hampshire, South East England, England","We are investigators, problem solvers, brilliant thinkers, relentless explorers, we are Ultra!
At Ultra Cyber you will be:
Given a wealth of development opportunities with a clear career plan in-mind
Provided with internal and external training opportunities
Work on state-of-the-art Cyber Security equipment within high-grade crypto and information assurance
Part of an agile organisation, with the ability to make a real difference
Involved in multiple domains and projects, throughout the engineering lifecycle
Work in a dynamic environment, with the ability to make significant personal impact
Have exposure to all functional and business areas, with opportunities to broaden your knowledge
In an environment where talent is recognised and promoted
Role Purpose
This isn’t your usual Cyber Engineering role. You’ll be part of a small, highly motivated team of all-rounder engineers, working on some of the most exciting national security challenges in an agile Research and Development setting.
Our research is anything but mundane. We take the “Is that even possible?” ideas and make them work (or prove they don’t). Software, hardware, physics, maths, other disciplines - we use it all. If we don’t know it, we will learn it or go and find someone who does; working with academia and subcontracted companies is part of the role. In addition to doing or directing cutting edge research we get our hands dirty; we build prototypes, we wield spanners, soldering irons and high end test gear. We test things in the real world, alongside end users.
What we are looking for isn’t the ordinary. You may be early career, you may be a time served professional. Maybe you are joining us from one of the services. Individual diversity is valued; we want people from different backgrounds who approach problems from different viewpoints and think a little differently. What matters to us more than your precise background and where you are in your career progression is your passion, your can-do attitude, your competence across a range of technical subjects, your problem solving capabilities and your ability to work with the team.
The role involves close interaction with our customers and subcontractors at all levels of seniority. There is some (mainly UK) travel, with some overnight stays, but you’ll be usually based at our facility in Farnborough. You will need to be capable of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of UK security clearance – so, unfortunately, you’ll have to be a UK national to join us.
Key responsibilities:
Help to explore and understand customer problems, generate requirement specifications and define research tasks to address them
Develop innovative solutions to technical problems small and large, researching them yourself or pulling in experts from subcontractors as appropriate
Interact with subcontractors – from technical level collaboration to managing the relationship
Produce project and technical documents, following appropriate processes, to ensure customer requirements are satisfied
Plan, co-ordinate and present at internal and external planning, project and design reviews, to senior management and customers
Actively contribute to and/or lead defined aspects of the project to achieve optimal balance between requirements, schedule and cost
Personal attributes:
Essential
A bright and inquisitive mind, who wishes to challenge the status quo, and propose new and novel solutions in order to make a difference
The ability to work with customers to develop great technical solutions to their complex engineering problems
Capable of developing high quality documentation and engineering artefacts
Excellent general written and verbal communications skills
Willing to undergo, and able to achieve and maintain, DV security clearance
Desirable
Experience in working with multiple engineering and physics disciplines including software, electronic/mechanical hardware, RF, optics, sonics etc.
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of IP networking
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of industrial mathematics and/or signal processing, including MATLAB
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of cryptography, cybersecurity and information security
Wide general knowledge of technical topics and willing to keep up to date on latest research
Every employee is critical to our success and as such we offer a range of flexible employee benefits including:
Bonus - performance related
25 days’ holiday with the option to buy an extra 5
4 x Life Assurance Cover
Flexible working hours
Early Finish on a Friday
Pension Contribution
Our Ultra Select Benefits package including – subsidised gym & retail, childcare vouchers, cycle to work schemes, etc.
Our Team
We trust and empower each other; we love to celebrate success and we win as a team. Together, we embrace change and we’re never satisfied until we’ve done what we said we’d do
Here at Ultra we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity and inclusivity. Underpinned by our values, behaviours and policies, we want you to feel empowered to be the best version of yourself. We also believe that people from different backgrounds and cultures will increase our diversity of thinking, ensuring we successfully deliver to our customers.
We therefore do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We also support requests for flexible working arrangements wherever possible. We are investigators, problem solvers, brilliant thinkers, relentless explorers, we are Ultra!

Cubica,5.0,Graduate Cyber & Networks Engineer 2023,"Romsey, England","Your Roke
Roke is curious, unashamedly technical and has worked at the leading edge of innovation for over 60 years. Roke Engineers work on a variety of exciting fields from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning to Sensors and Comms, and everything thing in between.
Roke is responsible for a plethora of fascinating technologies such as Hawk-Eye, Startle, RENS and even developed technology for the Mars Beagle Lander currently 200 million miles away. Our motto is “business unusual” and we strive to live by it!
As a Roke Graduate you can expect an exceptional platform to launch your career. With highly experienced, friendly and engaged colleagues who will support you each step of the way.
Your career chartered by you!
Graduates at Roke have access to a rich pool of varied opportunities. This could include developing deep specialist knowledge in a niche field. Broad knowledge across the tech stack. Domain expertise leading to more client-focused roles. Pastoral care and coaching via line management.
Your Learning and Development!
You’ll spend your first 6 weeks with your fellow graduate cohort on Roke’s bootcamp where you will sharpen your skills making sure you are fully prepared before joining your teams on live projects. A vast majority of the training we provide is carried out by engineers for engineers! Over the course of your first two years you will receive ongoing technical and soft skills training, developing your Roke portfolio which will support your salary reviews and career aspirations.
Roke are widely recognised as being among the best in their field therefore we have the foundations in place to ensure our Engineers develop the necessary skills to help solve our client’s toughest challenges.
Your Community!
Roke fosters a campus like feel on each of its sites, due in part to the relaxed dress code but more intrinsically by its people. We employ some of the best and brightest the world has to offer, but beyond that we employ people who are genuinely passionate about the technology they use and the work they do. Together this generates vibrant community of friendly individuals eager to support your development.
Roke prides itself on doing better each year on all aspects around the business and the community it serves. To aid in this we have Corporate Social Responsibility Groups (CSRGs) and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The CSRGs cover larger scale activates such as STEM outreach, Community outreach and Sustainability. ERGs are more specific, personal and focus on diversity & Inclusion.
A message from Roke’s Inspire - LGBT+ Support Network – “We provide support and advice, and champion inclusivity and understanding for anyone with questions around sexual orientation and gender identity. Membership is private and open to allies too”.
Roke also benefits from a plethora of employee-led clubs which cover everything from gaming to food. A few example clubs include Football, Climbing, Airsoft, Sailing, Cyber security, Data science, Astronomy, and much, much more!
Alongside this, there are numerous company events throughout the year, including a summer music festival, bonfire night (including fireworks, of course!) and a Christmas party.
Your Projects!
Unlike other working environments Roke maintains a project-orientated structure. This allows and encourages you to “try out” a variety of skills and roles throughout your career. You could finish an Artificial Intelligence Python project then move onto a Vison processing C++ project. You might also split your weeks with Bidding activities and running a small team. There’s a large amount of flexibility by design and it’s up to you how you engage with this feature. Finally, please note this isn’t a perk just for new starters but an intrinsic part of Roke. We routinely have senior engineers change projects to “try out something new” or juggle multiple projects because “they all sound fun!”
Your Application Process
Our hiring community will review your CV and supporting information from the application form. If we feel Roke would be a great fit for your aspirations you’ll be invited to an assessment centre.
Roke assessment days are both fun and challenging. You’ll meet the tech teams, receive a talk from a senior leader, receive a tour, have an interview and partake in super-fun, original team exercises. We will provide you with lunch and cover your travel expenses.

Ultra Electronics,3.6,Security Researcher,"Farnborough, Hampshire, South East England, England","We are investigators, problem solvers, brilliant thinkers, relentless explorers, we are Ultra!
At Ultra Cyber you will be:
Given a wealth of development opportunities with a clear career plan in-mind
Provided with internal and external training opportunities
Work on state-of-the-art Cyber Security equipment within high-grade crypto and information assurance
Part of an agile organisation, with the ability to make a real difference
Involved in multiple domains and projects, throughout the engineering lifecycle
Work in a dynamic environment, with the ability to make significant personal impact
Have exposure to all functional and business areas, with opportunities to broaden your knowledge
In an environment where talent is recognised and promoted
Role Purpose
This isn’t your usual Cyber Engineering role. You’ll be part of a small, highly motivated team of all-rounder engineers, working on some of the most exciting national security challenges in an agile Research and Development setting.
Our research is anything but mundane. We take the “Is that even possible?” ideas and make them work (or prove they don’t). Software, hardware, physics, maths, other disciplines - we use it all. If we don’t know it, we will learn it or go and find someone who does; working with academia and subcontracted companies is part of the role. In addition to doing or directing cutting edge research we get our hands dirty; we build prototypes, we wield spanners, soldering irons and high end test gear. We test things in the real world, alongside end users.
What we are looking for isn’t the ordinary. You may be early career, you may be a time served professional. Maybe you are joining us from one of the services. Individual diversity is valued; we want people from different backgrounds who approach problems from different viewpoints and think a little differently. What matters to us more than your precise background and where you are in your career progression is your passion, your can-do attitude, your competence across a range of technical subjects, your problem solving capabilities and your ability to work with the team.
The role involves close interaction with our customers and subcontractors at all levels of seniority. There is some (mainly UK) travel, with some overnight stays, but you’ll be usually based at our facility in Farnborough. You will need to be capable of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of UK security clearance – so, unfortunately, you’ll have to be a UK national to join us.
Key responsibilities:
Help to explore and understand customer problems, generate requirement specifications and define research tasks to address them
Develop innovative solutions to technical problems small and large, researching them yourself or pulling in experts from subcontractors as appropriate
Interact with subcontractors – from technical level collaboration to managing the relationship
Produce project and technical documents, following appropriate processes, to ensure customer requirements are satisfied
Plan, co-ordinate and present at internal and external planning, project and design reviews, to senior management and customers
Actively contribute to and/or lead defined aspects of the project to achieve optimal balance between requirements, schedule and cost
Personal attributes:
Essential
A bright and inquisitive mind, who wishes to challenge the status quo, and propose new and novel solutions in order to make a difference
The ability to work with customers to develop great technical solutions to their complex engineering problems
Capable of developing high quality documentation and engineering artefacts
Excellent general written and verbal communications skills
Willing to undergo, and able to achieve and maintain, DV security clearance
Desirable
Experience in working with multiple engineering and physics disciplines including software, electronic/mechanical hardware, RF, optics, sonics etc.
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of IP networking
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of industrial mathematics and/or signal processing, including MATLAB
Knowledge and interest and/or experience of cryptography, cybersecurity and information security
Wide general knowledge of technical topics and willing to keep up to date on latest research
Every employee is critical to our success and as such we offer a range of flexible employee benefits including:
Bonus - performance related
25 days’ holiday with the option to buy an extra 5
4 x Life Assurance Cover
Flexible working hours
Early Finish on a Friday
Pension Contribution
Our Ultra Select Benefits package including – subsidised gym & retail, childcare vouchers, cycle to work schemes, etc.
Our Team
We trust and empower each other; we love to celebrate success and we win as a team. Together, we embrace change and we’re never satisfied until we’ve done what we said we’d do
Here at Ultra we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity and inclusivity. Underpinned by our values, behaviours and policies, we want you to feel empowered to be the best version of yourself. We also believe that people from different backgrounds and cultures will increase our diversity of thinking, ensuring we successfully deliver to our customers.
We therefore do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We also support requests for flexible working arrangements wherever possible. We are investigators, problem solvers, brilliant thinkers, relentless explorers, we are Ultra!
