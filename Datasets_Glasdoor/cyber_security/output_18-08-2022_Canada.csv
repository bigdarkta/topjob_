CNL’s cyber security research team conducts leading edge research in cyber security of instrumentation and control systems in the nuclear industry and critical infrastructure. Digital security concerns and evolving standards and regulations are driving demand for safe and secure solutions by both business and industrial consumers. Unlike IT systems, industrial control systems are often bound by strict regulatory requirements and rigorous change controls that introduce complexities, risks and costs that are substantially higher for any modernization or modification and therefore requires specialists in I&C systems with cyber security expertise.

CNL is looking for a Cyber Security Research Scientist/Engineer who has a keen interest in cyber security and demonstrated aptitude for computer technology, software development and/or instrumentation and control application development.


DUTIES

Serve as a member of the cyber security research group, performing activities that range from conducting literature surveys to using technology to assess the suitability of various cyber security tools in industrial control system applications. Research areas may address cyber asset identification and classification, vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, penetration testing, countermeasures development and assessment, automated auditing, data analytics, and forensic analysis.
Support the installation, configuration and maintenance of a cyber test facility. Duties may include, for example, the installation and configuration of virtual servers, next generation firewalls, intrusion detection appliances, and process control simulation equipment.
Perform software development activities such as extending open-source software to add new features and functionality in support of cyber security projects
Prepare research reports in clear and compelling writing
Collaborate with other researchers and stakeholders.
Promote a strong security culture

QUALIFICATIONS

Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or Applied Mathematics from a university of recognized standing.
Introductory knowledge and/or experience with one or more cyber security technologies (e.g., intrusion detection systems, forensic analysis tools, next generation firewalls, application control, whitelisting, AV, encryption, automated auditing, analytics)
Software development experience with at least one programming/scripting language (e.g., C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Perl).
General knowledge and/or experience in aspects of the software development lifecycle and associated tools (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, integration, test, deployment, revision control, configuration management, change control).
Experience in the following technologies is highly desirable:
Modern computing technologies (e.g., VMWare and Hyper-V HyperVisors, switch and firewall configurations, Web Servers)
Operating systems (e.g., Windows, Windows Server, Linux)
Communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SSL)
I&C systems (e.g., PLCs, DCS)
Industrial I&C communication protocols (MODBUS, Profibus, OPC)
Initiative and ability to work effectively with others in a team environment, and have the ability to independently identify and solve technical problems.

CNL has been a world leader in developing peaceful and innovative applications from nuclear technology through its expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology and engineering. CNL’s 3500 highly skilled employees deliver a range of nuclear services – from research and development, design and engineering to specialized technology, waste management and decommissioning.

CNL’s cyber security research team conducts leading edge research in cyber security of instrumentation and control systems in the nuclear industry and critical infrastructure. Digital security concerns and evolving standards and regulations are driving demand for safe and secure solutions by both business and industrial consumers. Unlike IT systems, industrial control systems are often bound by strict regulatory requirements and rigorous change controls that introduce complexities, risks and costs that are substantially higher for any modernization or modification and therefore requires specialists in I&C systems with cyber security expertise.

CNL is looking for a Cyber Security Research Scientist/Engineer who has a keen interest in cyber security and demonstrated aptitude for computer technology, software development and/or instrumentation and control application development.


DUTIES

Serve as a member of the cyber security research group, performing activities that range from conducting literature surveys to using technology to assess the suitability of various cyber security tools in industrial control system applications. Research areas may address cyber asset identification and classification, vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, penetration testing, countermeasures development and assessment, automated auditing, data analytics, and forensic analysis.
Support the installation, configuration and maintenance of a cyber test facility. Duties may include, for example, the installation and configuration of virtual servers, next generation firewalls, intrusion detection appliances, and process control simulation equipment.
Perform software development activities such as extending open-source software to add new features and functionality in support of cyber security projects
Prepare research reports in clear and compelling writing
Collaborate with other researchers and stakeholders.
Promote a strong security culture

QUALIFICATIONS

Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or Applied Mathematics from a university of recognized standing.
Introductory knowledge and/or experience with one or more cyber security technologies (e.g., intrusion detection systems, forensic analysis tools, next generation firewalls, application control, whitelisting, AV, encryption, automated auditing, analytics)
Software development experience with at least one programming/scripting language (e.g., C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Perl).
General knowledge and/or experience in aspects of the software development lifecycle and associated tools (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, integration, test, deployment, revision control, configuration management, change control).
Experience in the following technologies is highly desirable:
Modern computing technologies (e.g., VMWare and Hyper-V HyperVisors, switch and firewall configurations, Web Servers)
Operating systems (e.g., Windows, Windows Server, Linux)
Communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SSL)
I&C systems (e.g., PLCs, DCS)
Industrial I&C communication protocols (MODBUS, Profibus, OPC)
Initiative and ability to work effectively with others in a team environment, and have the ability to independently identify and solve technical problems.
Excellent written and oral communication skills.
