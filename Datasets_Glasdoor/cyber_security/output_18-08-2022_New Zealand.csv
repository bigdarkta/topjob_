About MBIE:

MBIE's goal is to create a resilient and high-performing economy that delivers real and ongoing quality of life for all New Zealanders.
We do this by working with others to create an environment that supports businesses to be more productive and internationally competitive, enables all New Zealanders to participate in the economy through improved job opportunities and by working to ensure quality housing is more affordable.
People are at the heart of our mahi, our way of working is guided by our values which shape our behaviours.
Mahi Tahi – Better Together
Māia – Bold and brave
Pae Kahurangi – Build our Future
Pono Me Te Tika – Own It

Our aspirations are echoed in our Māori identity – Hīkina Whakatutuki – which broadly means ‘lifting to make successful'.
MBIE recognises the partnership founded under Te Tiriti o Waitangi between Māori and the Crown and is committed to giving effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. We will do this through enduring, meaningful and effective partnerships with iwi, Māori, other Māori groups/organisations and the Crown, as this is critical to enable economic and social development, both for Māori and for wider Aotearoa New Zealand. We are committed to continuing to partner with iwi in order to find new sustainable solutions to address long standing systemic and cross-cutting issues facing Māori and wider Aotearoa New Zealand and we are also committed to identifying opportunities for iwi to lead and creating an enabling environment for iwi to leverage these opportunities.
E mōhio ana a Hīkina Whakatutuki i puea ake te kōtuinga I waenganui i a ngāi Māori me te Karauna i Te Tiriti o Waitangi, ā, kei te whai ia ki te whakaū ake i Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

He āhuatanga nui tēnei e āhei ai ngā mahi whanaketanga ā-ohanga, ā-pāpori hoki ki a ngāi Māori me Aotearoa whānui. E whai tonu ana mātou ki te kōtui atu ki ngā iwi mō te rapu huarahi hou ki te whakaara i ngā kaupapakua roa nei e tāmi ana i a ngāi Māori me Aotearoa whānui, ā, e whai ana hoki ki te tautohu i ngā āheinga kōkiritanga mā ngā iwi, me te tautoko i ngā iwi kia whai mana ake ai ēnei āheinga.

Are you energised by solving curly problems through deep understanding of application logic?
Do you want to work in a genuinely collaborative environment where everyone has a voice?
Are you inspired by software that constantly wins awards around the world?
Gallagher is a rapidly growing technology company and global market leader, focused on protecting what matters most to customers around the world. Our technology protects some of the world’s highest security environments, and agriculture businesses in 160 countries, which makes us New Zealand’s leading privately owned global tech exporter.

To support our growth, we’re looking for a software developer to join our cyber security squad, as part of the R&D team working on our Enterprise physical security product.

You’ll also get to work on innovative and award winning products like our automated security audit tool: Security Health Check.
We work with a lot of different technologies, and we value broad skillsets. In particular it would be a bonus if you have some embedded or cloud experience (from either a development or security angle).
Our software has won multiple global awards, and we’re continuing to trailblaze – transitioning our on-premises application into the cloud, reinventing as we go. You will be part of this journey and opportunities will be available to those who are interested in growing their Cloud security and development skills.
We want to hear from you if you’re:
A creative problem solver, prepared to lean into the unknown and open to new learning
Someone who shares knowledge freely and cares about making things better
Motivated to write commercial software with a focus on code longevity and quality (including automated unit testing)
Energised by solving the curliest problems and deeply understanding application logic
Passionate about application security
And if you have experience in:
C# and/or C++
Ruby
Desktop or Server Application development
SQL databases – PostgreSQL, SQL Server or similar
Working in agile teams
Cyber Security (highly desirable)
What we offer
You’ll be joining a responsive future focused team of developers with a supportive, flexible work culture. It’s the culture at Gallagher that results in 94% of our people saying they are proud to work here.

Who we’re looking for
To support our growth, we’re looking for a software developer to join our cyber security squad, as part of the R&D team working on our Enterprise physical security product. If you are a developer with some C++ experience, and you’ve got either a background or interest in cyber security (or are keen to learn!), we’d love to hear from you.

We work with a lot of different technologies, and we value broad skillsets. In particular it would be a bonus if you have some embedded or cloud experience (from either a development or security angle).
Our software has won multiple global awards, and we’re continuing to trailblaze – transitioning our on-premises application into the cloud, reinventing as we go. You will be part of this journey and opportunities will be available to those who are interested in growing their Cloud security and development skills.
We want to hear from you if you’re:
A creative problem solver, prepared to lean into the unknown and open to new learning
Someone who shares knowledge freely and cares about making things better
Motivated to write commercial software with a focus on code longevity and quality (including automated unit testing)
Energised by solving the curliest problems and deeply understanding application logic
Passionate about application security
And if you have experience in:
C# and/or C++
Ruby
Desktop or Server Application development
SQL databases – PostgreSQL, SQL Server or similar
Working in agile teams

The capability to work across multiple projects at various stages of completion
An appreciation for the agile methodology
A mindset towards automation and scripting wherever possible
An openness to learning new technologies, capabilities and products

It is not required that you will have every technical skill in the below list, but experience in several of the areas is preferred

Technical capability and experience with SIEM deployments (ideally Splunk and/or Sentinel), their use and capabilities
Technical capability and experience with EDR deployments (ideally CrowdStrike and/or Defender), their use and capabilities
Technical capability and experience with Vulnerability assessment / management deployments (ideally Rapid 7), and familiarity with the vulnerability assessment / management process.
Technical capability and experience with operating systems such as Windows and Linux
Technical capability and experience with scripting and programming languages
Experience with networking devices, Firewalls (ideally Fortinet, Checkpoint, Palo Alto and/or zScaler) and proxies, etc
Experience with Virtualisation and Azure/AWS cloud technologies
Experience with and appreciation of the significance of the ITIL change management processes
