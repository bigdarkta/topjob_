Diagnose and fix issues discovered by QA testers and business users, and ensure timely release and deployment of updated app versions
Maintain clean, efficient, clearly-organized, and well-documented code
Gain experience with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) processes that provide data to the mobile app (current AWS experience is a definite plus!)
To be successful in this role, you will need:

Solid understanding of MVC / MVVM paradigms and Cocoa Touch design patterns

Punchcard Systems,5.0,Senior Mobile Developer,Edmonton,"At Punchcard, we’re in the process of inventing a new type of consulting agency, and we need great people to come along this journey with us. Our clients come to us to help them solve interesting challenges using technology. We are scaling our team and are looking for a Senior Mobile Application Developer to support the operations of the organization.

You'll be joining our team at an interesting time; we are still small, but we are growing, and we need people to help shape the future of Punchcard. If you have several years of experience as a software developer, have worked on projects with a variety of clients and users and are excited about the opportunity to work with and mentor a growing team and roll up your sleeves to create some amazing software, then this could be the role for you.

Your Typical Day

Starting in the morning, you’ll gather with your project team and project leads to go over everything that happened in the previous day, and all the context necessary for today. Blockers will be raised, and plans made to mitigate or remove them. If clarity is needed, the daily stand-up is where you’ll find it.

From there, you’ll fire up your IDE (we like VS Code) and start working, finding some available tasks in Dev Ops. If you’ve got questions, your fellow leads are just a collaboration call away, where you can pair program on difficult tasks or explore solutions together. Once you’ve finished a task or user story, it’s off to git to check it in via pull request for approval and final checks.

Finally, the whole team gets together to scope out and reflect on the days work, figure out what tomorrow looks like, and send the client a build.

Responsibilities

Technical

Support the entire application lifecycle (shape, design, test, release, and support).

Ensure new and legacy applications meet quality standards.

Continually identify areas of improvement with respect to development process, product maintainability, quality, and technology stack.
Lead by example to develop a team culture of ownership and accountability.
Consistently deliver on commitments made internally and externally and hold others to the same high standards of accountability.

Necessary Skills

A love of solving interesting problems.
3 - 5+ years of actual experience working as a software developer.
Demonstrable portfolio of released applications on the App store or the Android market.
In-depth experience with React, React Native or another JavaScript framework.
Experience with back-end technologies such as C# or .NETCore.
Familiarity with cloud and CI/CD systems such as Fastlane, Microsoft Azure, DevOps and AppCenter.

Excellent written and oral communication skills.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
Ability to multi-task to manage competing demands.
A degree in computer science, design, business, or technology or comparable work experience.
High personal integrity and team-orientation.

In the early days, they jokingly referred to us as the Uber-of-the-oilfield. We eventually decided to sell our trucks and market the software to large energy producers struggling with the same problems we had. Over the years, IronSight has evolved into a platform for intelligent field operations that helps large industrial operations and service providers work more efficiently together.Our apps take a job through its entire life cycle: from request, to scheduling, to execution, to field ticketing, and finally to analytics.
