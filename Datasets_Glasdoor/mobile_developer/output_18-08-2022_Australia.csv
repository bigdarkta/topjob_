Our purpose is to change the way the world experiences property. No matter where you're at on your property journey, we're here to help on every step - whether that's buying, selling, renting or renovating.

Work with reactive programming paradigm.
Who we’re looking for
But we don’t just look for someone based on their skills and expertise. It’s our connection, acceptance and genuine care for each other that makes REA a great place to work. That means you also need to be:
You love Android development (or desperately want to be an Android dev !), but with an open mind to working on iOS apps from time to time if the need arises
Knowledge of software design patterns and best practices for software development
Active contribution in technical decision-making process – we love hearing from every single person in the squad !
Work productively in a fast paced and agile environment
Happy to ask questions and challenge the status quo
An existing investment and ongoing commitment in your own learning and/or career change pathway (Hackathons, Short Courses and other Self-learning)
A growth mindset - it's not about what you know but how you learn
A focus on collaboration, communication and alignment with the REA values (see link for more info) - https://www.rea-group.com/careers/rea-culture/our-values/

The physical, mental, emotional and financial health of our people is something we’ll never stop caring about. This is a place to learn and grow. We’re committed to your development – both professionally and personally. Your experience with us is something we take seriously.
We offer:
A flexible working environment, meaning we strike the balance of what you need and what works for the business (and yes, our leaders fully understand the benefits of working flexibly)

Oh, and by the way:
At REA we value diversity and inclusion in all forms. Gender, religion, ethnicity, LBTGIQ+, neurodiversity and so much more. Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you've got the must-haves, dedication and enthusiasm to learn but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.
If you like the sound of us, then we think you should apply today. We're proud to be Circle Back Initiative Employer and we commit to respond to every applicant. While we're looking at your application, and preparing to come back to you with an update, why not get to know us a bit more through our various social channels? We're REA

Luxury Escapes,4.2,iOS Developer,Sydney,"Here at Luxury Escapes, our mission is to delight our customers with incredible deals for the world's best holidays.
Unlike most travel companies investing in our tech and our teams while the rest of the travel industry has done the opposite. We had been saying “it’s a funny time for a travel company to be hiring” – but that’s no longer true. Travel is bouncing back in a big way.
As customers return to travel with new habits, the industry is re-shaping itself, and a lot of business will move online. At Luxury Escapes, we want to take advantage of that shift. So, we are building new teams to help us deliver some very exciting projects, which we will tell you all about once you apply!
Our cross-functional teams include Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers, focused on delivering solutions and solving problems rather than simply completing tickets.
The structure is flat and the process super-lean, focusing on a culture of MVP, iteration, and ""build, measure, learn"", with continuous improvement at the heart of everything we do.
Our team share in-depth experience from the worlds of Android, iOS, Node/Typescript, React, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda, and more. We love learning and hold regular ""tech forums"" to learn from peers or discuss the tech issues of the day. We also have some really great developers, so you'll be both well supported and challenged!
As a Mobile Engineer here at Luxury Escapes you will be responsible for the delivery of features and enhancements relating to the Luxury Escapes mobile platform. We're part way through a complete re-build of both our iOS and Android apps, so it's an exciting time to be in the mobile team.
We're agile, so we have daily stand ups, autonomous teams, and developers deploy to production many times every day. We have a flat, collaborative structure both within and between teams.
We are operating a hybrid working model (collaboration is at the heart of everything we do) so you'll split your time in the office and a home. In Sydney, we are a short walk from Wynyard station, close to great lunch spots and cafes.
Employee experience is king here, with weekly events, monthly recognition programs and significant professional development opportunities. (We have won awards for it – but the HR team don’t like to brag much!)
Relevant skills:
Swift, Swift and Swift!
Reactive Programming (ReactiveSwift, RxSwift or Combine)
Experience with SwiftUI and Combine
Automated testing and continuous integration
High level of attention to detail and a passion for problem solving
Strong self-motivation
Good communication skills
A genuine passion for seeing our customers enjoying their escapes.
Nice to have: Android experience (we use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!) or Node.js
Benefits:
Excellent Remuneration package
20% Discount on Luxury Holidays and Experiences
Buy up to 4 weeks extra annual leave a year.
Health and Wellbeing programs
A bonus day of birthday leave
Flexible working conditions
Breakfast, coffee and fruit provided
A super collaborative team that enjoys creating great platforms
