Audicus,4.1,Mobile Developer,"New York, NY","WHO WE ARE
Audicus is a health-tech company based in New York City. We are changing the hearing aid industry with a leading telehealth solution that streamlines the hearing care experience from user testing to product delivery - both for consumers and providers. We are highly mission-driven and have reconnected, transformed and empowered tens of thousands of lives to date.
Position: Mobile Developer


ROLE BACKGROUND

We are looking for a part-time contractor to help rebuild and periodically update an iOS app. This is not a completely new build: we have an existing app that we are looking to port to a more sustainable production pipeline. The application is fairly basic, allowing for a data gathering experience/process to happen over-and-over again. The data from the application is then sent to our API. On top of rebuilding the application in a new language, we need to add some core features/experiences to make the app more robust. We have a list of features we want to add in the next 3-months, and ideally would have someone who could be available after those 3-months to help make incremental improvements as needed.


Rate: $110-$125/hour rate.


RESPONSIBILITIES

Rebuild existing app in new language (e.g., Flutter, or other)
Add 4-6 new features
Commitment of 5 - 10 hours/week
Projected experience to be 60-80 hours, then ongoing one-off requests monthly


SKILLS REQUIRED
Background/experience with React Native
Familiar with Flutter or other mobile platform
Ideally, priori experience with HIPAA data management

We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce. If you're excited about this role, but do not meet 100% of the qualifications listed above, we encourage you to apply. WHO WE ARE

About Peggy
Peggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Craig Follett and Adam Meghji, who have worked together for over 10 years, and sold their last business to Live Nation Entertainment.
In times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works.
Peggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.
About the Role
Peggy is looking for a talented Flutter developer to work on our mobile-first frontend app. You will be partnering with our design, backend, and technical leadership teams as we drive towards our exciting alpha release.
Our world-class design team extensively uses Figma to create hi-fi mobile interfaces. You are responsible for providing initial developer feedback to them directly and iterating in Figma, before building the interfaces in Flutter. The backend team will provide you with an elegant and well-documented GraphQL API as an entry-point into Peggy's content, data, and business logic, and can incorporate your feedback as the API's first consumer.

About Peggy
Peggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Craig Follett and Adam Meghji, who have worked together for over 10 years, and sold their last business to Live Nation Entertainment.
In times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works.
Peggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.

Why Quark might be a good fit for you
Our developers often have the opportunity to switch between different projects and clients.
Opportunities to learn new technologies - Cross-platform, Backend, Web
High degree of ownership in your project & codebase.
Our company is engineer-founded. We sympathize with developers and strive to make sure relationships with clients and management are good for our team. Our leaders are fully engaged with everyone. Salary Range - $50-110k
Benefits - 401(k) 1% matching, health & dental insurance, signing and yearly bonuses.
Technologies
Native iOS - Swift, Swift UI, Auto Layout, Realm, CoreData, Cocoapods, Swift Package Manager
Native Android - Kotlin, Realm / other local caching frameworks, View Binding, Android Jetpack
Cross-platform - React Native, Flutter
Our speciality is native development, so most of our projects focus on that but we have some work with cross-platform tech as well.
Location
Remote - available to seasoned developers. We would like you to visit for the first 1-2 weeks to get familiar with the team and 2-4 times a year normally. We will pay travel expenses.
On-site - our office is located in downtown Columbia, MO. Our team here works in person together 2-3 days a week and has flexibility with the rest of their schedule. We are asking junior developers to relocate.
About the role
At QuarkWorks, we have a variety of projects with small teams of 2-6 working together on one project at a time in an agile/scrum style. Each team is run by a technical lead / project manager with development experience. Usually there are opportunities to shift between teams every 6-12 months as we have some natural turnover with clients.
Current projects
Social media site for investors - imagine Twitter, but with more of a long-form discussion focus. We've released an iOS client and web app and are continuing to build and develop features. This is a 5 person team, currently with 2 iOS developers.
Hiring platform for students - we've been working on this project for 4 years and have a really well-developed and maintained codebase. We have a team of 4 working on this project right now with room to grow! With this client, we operate as the Android team in their company. We coordinate with their iOS, design and backend teams to keep iterating on new features. ex. Last year we worked on Twilio video chat integration for virtual career fairs.
Social video / games - unfortunately, we can't be super specific on this project, but we can say it's very exciting! We have available positions to join one of our senior developers working with this client.
We'd love to tell you more about what we're working on right now on a phone/video call!
What we're looking for
3+ years of industry mobile development experience in iOS/Android
Experience with Kotlin, Swift, Realm, CoreData, etc.
Capability to handle all aspects of a mobile app, from UI to networking & data to deployment

Audicus is a health-tech company based in New York City. We are changing the hearing aid industry with a leading telehealth solution that streamlines the hearing care experience from user testing to product delivery - both for consumers and providers. We are highly mission-driven and have reconnected, transformed and empowered tens of thousands of lives to date.
Position: Mobile Developer


ROLE BACKGROUND

We are looking for a part-time contractor to help rebuild and periodically update an iOS app. This is not a completely new build: we have an existing app that we are looking to port to a more sustainable production pipeline. The application is fairly basic, allowing for a data gathering experience/process to happen over-and-over again. The data from the application is then sent to our API. On top of rebuilding the application in a new language, we need to add some core features/experiences to make the app more robust. We have a list of features we want to add in the next 3-months, and ideally would have someone who could be available after those 3-months to help make incremental improvements as needed.


Rate: $110-$125/hour rate.


RESPONSIBILITIES

Rebuild existing app in new language (e.g., Flutter, or other)
Add 4-6 new features
Commitment of 5 - 10 hours/week
Projected experience to be 60-80 hours, then ongoing one-off requests monthly


SKILLS REQUIRED
Background/experience with React Native
Familiar with Flutter or other mobile platform
Ideally, priori experience with HIPAA data management

We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce. If you're excited about this role, but do not meet 100% of the qualifications listed above, we encourage you to apply. WHO WE ARE

We are changing the hearing aid industry with a leading telehealth solution that streamlines the hearing care experience from user testing to product delivery - both for consumers and providers. We are highly mission-driven and have reconnected, transformed and empowered tens of thousands of lives to date.
Position: Mobile Developer


ROLE BACKGROUND

We are looking for a part-time contractor to help rebuild and periodically update an iOS app. This is not a completely new build: we have an existing app that we are looking to port to a more sustainable production pipeline. The application is fairly basic, allowing for a data gathering experience/process to happen over-and-over again. The data from the application is then sent to our API. On top of rebuilding the application in a new language, we need to add some core features/experiences to make the app more robust. We have a list of features we want to add in the next 3-months, and ideally would have someone who could be available after those 3-months to help make incremental improvements as needed.


Rate: $110-$125/hour rate.


RESPONSIBILITIES

Rebuild existing app in new language (e.g., Flutter, or other)
Add 4-6 new features
Commitment of 5 - 10 hours/week
Projected experience to be 60-80 hours, then ongoing one-off requests monthly


SKILLS REQUIRED
Background/experience with React Native
Familiar with Flutter or other mobile platform
Ideally, priori experience with HIPAA data management

We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce. If you're excited about this role, but do not meet 100% of the qualifications listed above, we encourage you to apply. WHO WE ARE

Peggy,3.3,Mobile Developer - Flutter/Dart,"Ontario, CA","Mobile Developer - Flutter/Dart
About Peggy
Peggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Craig Follett and Adam Meghji, who have worked together for over 10 years, and sold their last business to Live Nation Entertainment.
In times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works.
Peggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.
About the Role
Peggy is looking for a talented Flutter developer to work on our mobile-first frontend app. You will be partnering with our design, backend, and technical leadership teams as we drive towards our exciting alpha release.

The backend team will provide you with an elegant and well-documented GraphQL API as an entry-point into Peggy's content, data, and business logic, and can incorporate your feedback as the API's first consumer.
