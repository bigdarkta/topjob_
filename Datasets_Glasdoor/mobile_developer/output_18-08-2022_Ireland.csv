Paddy Power Betfair,3.8,Java / Scala Developer,Dublin,"Java/Scala Engineer - Dublin based - Hybrid approach to WFH and office based working


What can I expect from the Role?

We are building a development function to continuously improve, extend or replace the existing stack of applications and systems under the ownership of the Trading Tribe at PPB. Projects undertaken by this group will be many and varied and will mean that in joining this team you will gain exposure to a wide variety of applications, development approaches and technologies. We have an opportunity to look at our existing estate and to find ways to add value through optimising, automating, re-architecting and through the addition of new features and creation of new platforms where necessary.

We use Scala and Java where appropriate to build our platforms, and are focused on using the right technology for each task.


Is this you?
You have experience using agile and lean practices to deliver world class software. You are a Kaizen creature who never stops thinking about how to improve yourself and your team.

When hardware fails, your applications keep going because they are fault tolerant. When the company grows, your applications scale right alongside. Customers enjoy using your applications, because they are reactive and always perform well.

You understand that building the ‘right thing' is as important as building the ‘thing right', and have leveraged test-driven techniques such as ATDD to achieve both. You believe that software quality is the responsibility of the whole team, regardless of job titles.

You understand and embrace the philosophy of Continuous Delivery. You have no interest in throwing your work ‘over the wall' to anybody. Instead, you passionately believe in an agile, DevOps-centric team that builds, tests, releases and operates its own applications.


What are the experiences & Qualifications Required?

Experience as a Java or Scala programmer
An understanding of Event-driven, messaging-based systems

Dependency Injection (experience in Spring an advantage)
Storage technologies (SQL and/or NoSQL)

Automated testing and mocking techniques
Clean coding

Paddy Power Betfair,3.8,Java / Scala Developer,Dublin,"Java/Scala Engineer - Dublin based - Hybrid approach to WFH and office based working


What can I expect from the Role?

We are building a development function to continuously improve, extend or replace the existing stack of applications and systems under the ownership of the Trading Tribe at PPB. Projects undertaken by this group will be many and varied and will mean that in joining this team you will gain exposure to a wide variety of applications, development approaches and technologies. We have an opportunity to look at our existing estate and to find ways to add value through optimising, automating, re-architecting and through the addition of new features and creation of new platforms where necessary.

We use Scala and Java where appropriate to build our platforms, and are focused on using the right technology for each task.


Is this you?
You have experience using agile and lean practices to deliver world class software. You are a Kaizen creature who never stops thinking about how to improve yourself and your team.

When hardware fails, your applications keep going because they are fault tolerant. When the company grows, your applications scale right alongside. Customers enjoy using your applications, because they are reactive and always perform well.

You understand that building the ‘right thing' is as important as building the ‘thing right', and have leveraged test-driven techniques such as ATDD to achieve both. You believe that software quality is the responsibility of the whole team, regardless of job titles.

You understand and embrace the philosophy of Continuous Delivery. You have no interest in throwing your work ‘over the wall' to anybody. Instead, you passionately believe in an agile, DevOps-centric team that builds, tests, releases and operates its own applications.


What are the experiences & Qualifications Required?

Experience as a Java or Scala programmer
An understanding of Event-driven, messaging-based systems
Messaging brokering technologies (experience in RabbitMQ and/or Kafka an advantage)
Dependency Injection (experience in Spring an advantage)
Storage technologies (SQL and/or NoSQL)
Test-driven development techniques (e.g. BDD and ATDD)
Automated testing and mocking techniques
Clean coding

REMOTE STRATEGY:

Algolia’s workplace strategy, Hybrid Remote, is designed to harness the power of the opportunities that remote work offers both employees and the company, while also providing an engaging in-office experience for the times when an employee is in an office. Our workplace approach reflects the belief that an employee’s impact, contribution, and output are more important than their physical location.

The majority of employees will be able to choose if, and when, they come into an office on a regular basis. There will be times when our people are asked to come into an office for “moments that matter:” activities like critical planning meetings and team social gatherings. Beyond those events, 80% of our workforce may choose the location from where they work in the country in which they were hired.

We have physical offices in San Francisco, NYC, Atlanta, Paris, London, Austin, and Bucharest. https://www.algolia.com/about/

ABOUT US:

Algolia prides itself on being a pioneer and market leader offering an AI-powered, API-First Search & Discovery platform that empowers 12,000+ businesses to compose customer experiences at internet scale that predict what their users want with blazing fast search and web browse experience. Algolia powers more than 30 billion search requests a week – four times more than Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex and DuckDuckGo combined.

Algolia is part of a cadre of innovative new companies that are driving the next generation of software development, creating APIs that make developers’ lives easier; solutions that are better than building from scratch and better than having to tweak monolithic SaaS solutions.

In 2021, the company closed $150 million in series D funding and quadrupled its post-money valuation of $2.25 billion. Being well capitalized enables Algolia to continue to invest in its market leading platform, to better serve its thousands of customers–including Under Armor, Petsmart, Stripe, Gymshark, and Walgreens, to name just a few.

The team is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Paris, London, New York, Austin, Atlanta, and Bucharest. To learn more, visit www.algolia.com.

WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:

We’re looking for talented, passionate people to build the world’s best search & discovery technology. As an ownership-driven company, we seek team members who thrive within an environment based on autonomy and diversity. We're committed to building an inclusive and diverse workplace. We care about each other and the world around us, and embrace talented people regardless of their race, age, ancestry, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, color, veteran status, disability and socioeconomic background.

 #LI-Hybrid #LI-Remote REMOTE STRATEGY:

Algolia’s workplace strategy, Hybrid Remote, is designed to harness the power of the opportunities that remote work offers both employees and the company, while also providing an engaging in-office experience for the times when an employee is in an office. Our workplace approach reflects the belief that an employee’s impact, contribution, and output are more important than their physical location.

The majority of employees will be able to choose if, and when, they come into an office on a regular basis. There will be times when our people are asked to come into an office for “moments that matter:” activities like critical planning meetings and team social gatherings. Beyond those events, 80% of our workforce may choose the location from where they work in the country in which they were hired.

We have physical offices in San Francisco, NYC, Atlanta, Paris, London, Austin, and Bucharest. https://www.algolia.com/about/

ABOUT US:

Algolia prides itself on being a pioneer and market leader offering an AI-powered, API-First Search & Discovery platform that empowers 12,000+ businesses to compose customer experiences at internet scale that predict what their users want with blazing fast search and web browse experience. Algolia powers more than 30 billion search requests a week – four times more than Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex and DuckDuckGo combined.

Algolia is part of a cadre of innovative new companies that are driving the next generation of software development, creating APIs that make developers’ lives easier; solutions that are better than building from scratch and better than having to tweak monolithic SaaS solutions.

In 2021, the company closed $150 million in series D funding and quadrupled its post-money valuation of $2.25 billion. Being well capitalized enables Algolia to continue to invest in its market leading platform, to better serve its thousands of customers–including Under Armor, Petsmart, Stripe, Gymshark, and Walgreens, to name just a few.

The team is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Paris, London, New York, Austin, Atlanta, and Bucharest. To learn more, visit www.algolia.com.

WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:

We’re looking for talented, passionate people to build the world’s best search & discovery technology. As an ownership-driven company, we seek team members who thrive within an environment based on autonomy and diversity. We're committed to building an inclusive and diverse workplace. We care about each other and the world around us, and embrace talented people regardless of their race, age, ancestry, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, color, veteran status, disability and socioeconomic background.

Today, we're the only 100% Direct EOR in the world, partnering with clients to get to market 82% faster, at a reduced cost, and with lower risk through local expertise in over 160 countries.


Atlas technology powers the idea that companies can employ whoever they want, wherever they are in the world. Through our cloud-based platform, we deliver the Human Resources infrastructure that underpins international growth, leaving companies free to focus on the strategy that makes it happen. We partner with our clients through their international life cycle from the first dip in the global pool until the moment it's time to set up their own entities and run payroll. Atlas is here from point A to point Z.


The future of work is borderless, and so are we. So, it helps that our people are located around the globe — in the US, UK, India, China and beyond — and speak 90+ languages. Diversity and inclusion are at our core.


We're excited about our next phase of growth. We're launching new tech, adding new solutions and now we're looking for YOU — eager for a challenge, energized by innovation and aligned with our mission to deliver a future of work without borders.

What can I expect from the Role?

We are building a development function to continuously improve, extend or replace the existing stack of applications and systems under the ownership of the Trading Tribe at PPB. Projects undertaken by this group will be many and varied and will mean that in joining this team you will gain exposure to a wide variety of applications, development approaches and technologies. We have an opportunity to look at our existing estate and to find ways to add value through optimising, automating, re-architecting and through the addition of new features and creation of new platforms where necessary.

We use Scala and Java where appropriate to build our platforms, and are focused on using the right technology for each task.


Is this you?
You have experience using agile and lean practices to deliver world class software. You are a Kaizen creature who never stops thinking about how to improve yourself and your team.

When hardware fails, your applications keep going because they are fault tolerant. When the company grows, your applications scale right alongside. Customers enjoy using your applications, because they are reactive and always perform well.

You understand that building the ‘right thing' is as important as building the ‘thing right', and have leveraged test-driven techniques such as ATDD to achieve both. You believe that software quality is the responsibility of the whole team, regardless of job titles.

You understand and embrace the philosophy of Continuous Delivery. You have no interest in throwing your work ‘over the wall' to anybody. Instead, you passionately believe in an agile, DevOps-centric team that builds, tests, releases and operates its own applications.


What are the experiences & Qualifications Required?

Experience as a Java or Scala programmer
An understanding of Event-driven, messaging-based systems
Messaging brokering technologies (experience in RabbitMQ and/or Kafka an advantage)
Dependency Injection (experience in Spring an advantage)
Storage technologies (SQL and/or NoSQL)
Test-driven development techniques (e.g. BDD and ATDD)
Automated testing and mocking techniques
Clean coding

Paddy Power Betfair,3.8,Java / Scala Developer,Dublin,"Java/Scala Engineer - Dublin based - Hybrid approach to WFH and office based working


What can I expect from the Role?

We are building a development function to continuously improve, extend or replace the existing stack of applications and systems under the ownership of the Trading Tribe at PPB. Projects undertaken by this group will be many and varied and will mean that in joining this team you will gain exposure to a wide variety of applications, development approaches and technologies. We have an opportunity to look at our existing estate and to find ways to add value through optimising, automating, re-architecting and through the addition of new features and creation of new platforms where necessary.

We use Scala and Java where appropriate to build our platforms, and are focused on using the right technology for each task.


Is this you?
You have experience using agile and lean practices to deliver world class software. You are a Kaizen creature who never stops thinking about how to improve yourself and your team.

When hardware fails, your applications keep going because they are fault tolerant. When the company grows, your applications scale right alongside. Customers enjoy using your applications, because they are reactive and always perform well.

You understand that building the ‘right thing' is as important as building the ‘thing right', and have leveraged test-driven techniques such as ATDD to achieve both. You believe that software quality is the responsibility of the whole team, regardless of job titles.

You understand and embrace the philosophy of Continuous Delivery. You have no interest in throwing your work ‘over the wall' to anybody. Instead, you passionately believe in an agile, DevOps-centric team that builds, tests, releases and operates its own applications.


What are the experiences & Qualifications Required?

Experience as a Java or Scala programmer
An understanding of Event-driven, messaging-based systems

Dependency Injection (experience in Spring an advantage)
Storage technologies (SQL and/or NoSQL)

Automated testing and mocking techniques
Clean coding
