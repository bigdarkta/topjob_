Socially positive product and a great working environment


JNCTN are up-and-comers in the NZ tech scene and are looking for a Front End developer to join their high-performing engineering team.

ABOUT THE ROLE

You will be joining our front-end team in creating, coding, and refining intuitive and enjoyable front-end experiences for our users.

We are looking for someone who is interested in SaaS and emerging technologies in the Identity and credential management ecosystem and is looking to develop their front-end skills and career.


HOW DO WE WORK?

We value agility, simplicity, and visibility in the code we write. Measurement and goal setting allow us to meet our development milestones, adjusting our understanding based on learnings and feedback from our customers and the rapidly changing ecosystem we are working in.


HOW WILL I KNOW WHAT NEEDS DOING?

You will work with some of the strongest front-end team leads in the Welly startup market, who will provide guidance, user stories and describe business values that need to be implemented. We prioritise stories to know what to do next. Reviews provide feedback and opportunities to re-prioritse. Meet-ups keep us all in touch.


WHAT SKILLS ARE WE LOOKING FOR?


React skills, or experience in similar frameworks like Vue JS or Angular 2+

HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills, experience with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS are both bonuses
Exposure to CI/CD tooling e.g., Jenkins, Octopus Deploy, Circle, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions

Familiarity with Git

Experience with unit testing frameworks like Jest, experience with Cypress is also a plus

Experience working with React hooks and JSX

1-3+ years’ professional experience – we’re also keen to see any personal projects you might have on the go

A pragmatic & proactive attitude – we’re looking for people who want to get things done and work through challenges (with support from your team)

Communication skills – you don’t need to be a public speaker or anything, we’re just looking for you to communicate clearly and honestly with your team and to listen with compassion to different viewpoints.

Interested in continuously learning and developing your technical and professional skills

.NET and full-stack experience are both a plus but no worries if you don’t have them


WHY SHOULD YOU JOIN US?


Experienced technical leadership providing great learning opportunities and mentorship

Cutting edge technology: Technology is at the core of what we do, so our existing tech stack is very modern, and we always have an eye to improve on it.

Mobile platforms: future opportunities to explore iOS and Android development with React Native

Work that makes a difference: You’ll have the opportunity to work on products that are used every day to help make workplaces safer for everyone

Flexible work: We offer remote work options and flexible hours. We trust that our people know how and where they work best, and we want to support them to do their best work.

Career development: We want to understand where you are looking to go in your career and help provide opportunities to get you there.

Innovation: Joining our team is an opportunity to be at the forefront of a new industry, where you are creating world-leading solutions and constantly learning. We want you to pitch your ideas and make your mark on our company.

Diversity, equity, & inclusion: We’re committed to constantly learning and increasing our team diversity and we’re doing this by valuing all voices, prioritising culture-add over culture fit, and creating equitable and unbiased workplace systems.

Competitive Compensation: We offer a competitive salary in line with current market rates as well as five weeks of annual leave, and the opportunity to join our employee stock ownership program in the future.


THE COMPANY

We’re a pretty mixed bunch of software engineers and product experts and are committed long-term to building a diverse and productive team. We’re busy and we have some ambitious projects on the go, but you’ll find our working style is supportive, flexible and we’ll have fun on the journey.
We pay well, look after the team and also offer an employee share option scheme.
If you love building new tech, enjoy the odd curry/kebab and are excited to be part of a Kiwi born-and-bred SaaS company, that’s still in startup mode, and on a rapid international growth trajectory then JNCTN is the place for you.

Specialized Bicycle Components,4.1,Senior UI Developer - (New Zealand - work remotely),Christchurch,"Are you ready to combine your passion for an active lifestyle with a meaningful and multifaceted career in the cycling industry? At Specialized, our teammates are encouraged to explore roles in a variety of functions throughout their careers. We value curiosity, a desire to try new things, and an eagerness to learn about all aspects of the business. No matter where you begin with the company, you get to decide where you want to go whether it’s marketing, finance, product development, sales, or an international assignment. Join us in making the world a better place through the power of bicycles and build your dream career at the same time!

Location: New Zealand

We are looking for a motivated and proactive Senior UI Developer to help us develop our front-end web services. These services are used by our riders, retailers and internal Specialized teammates. Our websites are written in a variety of technology stacks and languages, and for this role the focus is on Angular single page web applications. You may also be required to step into other stacks such as React, Angular JS or other legacy web development environments. Development duties on web applications will include design and development of both JavaScript, HTML and CSS Angular components.

You will be expected to work closely with the backend teams to assist in identifying and defining the required REST endpoints to best serve the web applications. You will often work without a dedicated designer, and it is important that you can work independently and apply best practice and consistent designs to the screens you develop. You will need to lead by example and demonstrate to others how our best practices and target architecture can be adopted and used. It is important to stay up to date on best practices, and to actively communicate these through to the team

Experience in a small, fast paced environment is crucial – we are light on our feet!

How you’ll make a difference

Design new solutions and develop on our preferred web application stacks: Angular (single page applications with REST backend services).
Develop and maintain existing solutions on our legacy server/cloud stacks (Angular JS, React).

We are looking for a motivated and proactive Senior UI Developer to help us develop our front-end web services. These services are used by our riders, retailers and internal Specialized teammates. Our websites are written in a variety of technology stacks and languages, and for this role the focus is on Angular single page web applications. You may also be required to step into other stacks such as React, Angular JS or other legacy web development environments. Development duties on web applications will include design and development of both JavaScript, HTML and CSS Angular components.

You will be expected to work closely with the backend teams to assist in identifying and defining the required REST endpoints to best serve the web applications. You will often work without a dedicated designer, and it is important that you can work independently and apply best practice and consistent designs to the screens you develop. You will need to lead by example and demonstrate to others how our best practices and target architecture can be adopted and used. It is important to stay up to date on best practices, and to actively communicate these through to the team

Experience in a small, fast paced environment is crucial – we are light on our feet!

Luxury Escapes,4.3,Senior iOS Developer,Auckland,"Here at Luxury Escapes, our mission is to delight our customers with incredible deals for the world's best holidays.
Unlike most travel companies, we’ve been investing in our tech and our teams while the rest of the travel industry has done the opposite. We had been saying “it’s a funny time for a travel company to be hiring” – but that’s no longer true. Travel is bouncing back in a big way.
As customers return to travel with new habits, the industry is re-shaping itself, and a lot of business will move online. At Luxury Escapes, we want to take advantage of that shift. So, we are building new teams to help us deliver some very exciting projects, which we will tell you all about once you apply!
Our cross-functional teams include Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers, focused on delivering solutions and solving problems rather than simply completing tickets.
The structure is flat and the process super-lean, focusing on a culture of MVP, iteration, and ""build, measure, learn"", with continuous improvement at the heart of everything we do.
Our team share in-depth experience from the worlds of Android, iOS, Node/Typescript, React, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda, and more. We love learning and hold regular ""tech forums"" to learn from peers or discuss the tech issues of the day. We also have some really great developers, so you'll be both well supported and challenged!
As a Senior Mobile Engineer here at Luxury Escapes you will be responsible for the delivery of features and enhancements relating to the Luxury Escapes mobile platform. We're part way through a complete re-build of both our iOS and Android apps, so it's an exciting time to be in the mobile team.
We're agile, so we have daily stand ups, autonomous teams, and developers deploy to production many times every day. We have a flat, collaborative structure both within and between teams.
We are looking to appoint remote mobile engineers located anywhere in New Zealand on a full time basis! We already have a great team in NZ and we are looking to grow our capability with exceptional NZ talent!
Employee experience is king here, with weekly events, monthly recognition programs and significant professional development opportunities. (We have won awards for it – but the HR team don’t like to brag much!)
Relevant skills:
Swift, Swift and Swift!
Reactive Programming (ReactiveSwift, RxSwift or Combine)
Experience with SwiftUI and Combine
Automated testing and continuous integration
High level of attention to detail and a passion for problem solving
Strong self-motivation
Good communication skills
A genuine passion for seeing our customers enjoying their escapes.
Nice to have: Android experience (we use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!) or Node.js
Benefits:
Excellent Remuneration package
20% Discount on Luxury Holidays and Experiences
Buy up to 4 weeks extra annual leave a year.
Health and Wellbeing programs
A bonus day of birthday leave
Flexible working conditions
A super collaborative team that enjoys creating great platforms
If this role sounds appealing but you don't check every box, apply anyway, we want to hear what you can do!

Spark New Zealand,4.0,Technical Product Owner - Delivery Lead,Auckland,"About Spark
We are Spark, New Zealand's largest and multi-brand digital services company offering mobile, fixed and IT products and services to millions of New Zealand consumers and businesses. Home to inspired, forward thinkers, Spark people are at the heart of our purpose to get stuck in to enable New Zealanders to unleash their own incredible potential using the amazing technology and digital experiences we deliver. Our progressive, straight up approach to technology is evolving every day and we have a thirst for fresh, creative energy to join us in sparking New Zealand's digital future.
Principal brand Spark supports home, consumer mobile and small business customers and Spark Digital powers government and business customers with strong Cloud services, mobility, and ICT capabilities. Specialist and flanking brands include Skinny, CCL, Digital Island and Qrious.
We live the agile life at Spark - our teams work in squads and sprints to maximise the pace of delivery for our customers and bring the future faster to New Zealand.
About the role:
This role sits within our Domain Chapter for Enterprise Automation. Our chapter consists of software developers, application support engineers and automation engineers who deliver both operational and project outcomes.
We are currently looking for an Auckland based technical product owner or delivery lead to join our team and work with our newly formed ERP (MS Dynamics Finance & Operations) squad to deliver a backlog of BAU, operational support and strategic project initiatives.
This is a truly diverse role which calls for a multi-tasker who thrives in a technically complex environment and has a track record in delivering results - you might have project management, service delivery or previous product owner expertise coupled with the ability to collaborate with both deep technical specialists and senior business leaders.
Key Responsibilities:
Working collaboratively with technical & functional chapter members and architects in an agile squad structure to manage and maintain the end-to-end ERP solution so that the business processes and outcomes are supported.
Working collaboratively with our business user communities and stakeholders to understand the key business processes, such as HR, Procurement and Finance and helping to deliver continuous improvement initiatives to improve user experience.
Providing leadership to the team and helping them deliver operational support outcomes - including incident and problem management; defect and error handling; service request fulfilment; and product lifecycle maintenance (upgrade and regression).
Helping the team to prioritise and deliver a backlog of functional and technical changes into the ERP solution driven from BAU business process change, minor projects and strategic programmes of work.
Managing and maintaining the squad backlog, driving squad performance and results that are aligned to business priorities
Driving operational best practice and governance
Pushing the boundaries - encouraging a culture of learning, pace, innovation and improvement
Adopting the best agile ways of working - embedding the right practices, mindset and standards
Inspiring and leading others towards better results
What you need:
Demonstrable ability to coach and lead technical teams in complex technical environments and a track record in delivery
Collaboration as a super-power - ability to work with technical specialists from architects to developers and to work with business communities from end users to executives
Ideally, 3+ years' operational experience working within an Enterprise ERP environment - exposure to MS Dynamics Finance & Operations AX would be awesome but is not essential
Ideally, operational, service delivery or project management experience in a complex, multi-technology environment with on prem & cloud hosted applications - familiarity with some of the following would be a benefit: Azure DevOps, MS Power Platform (Automate, PowerApps, PowerBI), Azure, Snowflake, RedHat Fuse, SOAP, REST
Demonstrable leadership and problem-solving capabilities
Ability to multi-task, prioritise and pivot with pace - and a cool head under pressure
A willingness to get stuck in and a 'can -do' attitude - a willingness to lean in and take on new responsibilities in order to deliver business outcomes
Demonstrable learning agility & a growth mindset
Excellent written and verbal communications skills - with an ability to communicate effectively at all levels, both with technical and functional teams and with business stakeholders.
Culture
People enjoy working in this team because the work is fast paced and technically challenging. We're also a dedicated bunch and we're passionate about agile delivery. We work hard, but also like to have fun! We're also a truly diverse and inclusive company where everyone can relax and be themselves.
Benefits
Spark aims to be the place where the smartest, most digitally savvy talent wants to work, in an inclusive, diverse workplace.
We grow great teams, led by the best leaders at the top of their game, by enabling our people the freedom and scope to do their best work, and by offering opportunities to develop their talent.
Benefits include career breaks, summer hours, extended annual leave purchasing, discounted health insurance, option to access great value holiday homes through Marram Trust, careers fairs, leadership development, training options and individual emphasis on corporate social responsibility and community involvement through the Spark Foundation (including volunteer days).
Additionally, we offer a monthly Spark account credit (subject to credit criteria) across all our services, Spark Cover (free life and income protection insurance), access to our employee share scheme, as well as a wide range of discounted partner products and services among New Zealand's most well-known retailers.

Job summary

The world is getting smaller and moving faster. What helped companies become successful a decade ago no longer works. Being agile, experimenting more and faster, pivoting, seizing market opportunities is now a matter of survival for startups and enterprises alike.



AWS customers are unshackling themselves from traditional boxes & wires by adopting secure elastic infrastructure, and higher-level services across all areas of technology, from DevOps and Containers to Server-less, Connected Everything (IoT), Mobile, Data Lakes and Analytics (D&A), Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). Many of these customers can’t do it on their own and are looking for quality professional services and consulting firms (aka systems integrators) to help them on their cloud transformation journey.

To best serve our consulting partners and ensure their success, we are looking for technologists who have a knack for helping companies understand cloud, and a passion for learning and for sharing their knowledge with others. Opportunities like this come once in a generation - don't watch history unfold from the sidelines - join us to to build the future together!

About Salesforce


Founded in 1999, Salesforce is the global leader in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Companies of every size and industry are using Salesforce to transform their businesses, across sales, service, marketing, commerce, and more by connecting with customers in a whole new way.


Salesforce is built on a set of four core values: Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality and Sustainability. By making technology more accessible, we're helping create a future with greater opportunity and equality for all. This has taken our company to great heights, including being named one of the FORTUNE ""100 Best Companies to Work For®"" 2020 — 12 years in a row.


The Role


The Technical Solution Architect is an experienced industry expert who partners with the sales team, professional services team and customer success team to configure, build, demo, architect and articulate the value of our innovative industry solutions to our prospects and customers. Meeting with C-level, Director-level, management-level and user-level customer contacts, the Solutions Engineer must be able to easily adapt to each type of conversation, whether it’s strategic and high-level, or highly detailed and technical.


Also known as a “Solution Engineer”, ""Pre-sales Consultant"", ""Sales Consultant"", or “Sales Engineer” the Solution Architect is responsible for leading the solutioning throughout the sales cycle and delivering thought leadership to companies to transform their customer’s experience.


To accomplish this, you should have a strong desire to set an industry-specific digital vision, translating business objectives into relevant, actionable and value-based recommendations, plus importantly to become a trusted technical advisor to our prospects/customers while aiding their transformational journey.
Manage enterprise organisations across a range of industries to understand their challenges and goals through focused discovery sessions and workshops in order to establish Salesforce as a preferred strategic partner

Fully understand and clearly articulate the unique benefits of Salesforce to a wide range of customer stakeholders from front line staff right up to C-level executives
Present compelling Salesforce & partner solutions while supporting relationships with customers and partners
Coordinate and lead the entire solution cycle through close collaboration with a broad range of geographically distributed supporting technical and business resources
Display initiative, self motivation and deliver high quality results along with meeting all expectations for both internal and external customers.
The Solutions Team


We’re a fast-paced, light-hearted crew that works together, get the job done, and never takes ourselves too seriously. Our team has a unique background across technology, partners, customers, developers and industries. We are always looking for new team members to complement and strengthen our team, bringing new ways of thinking, diverse experience and in turn the ability to further your own career development.
About You
Experience in a comparable pre-sales position, supporting the sales cycle in selling CRM or other high value business solutions ideally with Enterprise customers.
Technical understanding of SAAS solutions and modern business applications including integration
Business value-selling
Business consulting or business analysis experience
Knowledge of Salesforce products and solutions or an understanding of the CRM marketplace
Passion for creating engaging customer experiences
Ability to work as part of a team to tackle business and technical problems
Familiarity with web & mobile technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
The Perks!
We know that in order to do our best work, we must first take care of ourselves. Therefore, Salesforce has a competitive set of benefits to enable you to stay well and do good!
Stay protected with Health Insurance, Income Protection and Life Insurance.
Look after yourself with time off and leave policies (including parental leave, family care leave, marriage leave and more), Financial Wellness Support, access to an Employee Assistance Program, and a wellbeing allowance every quarter.
Grow yourself with an Education Reimbursement Program, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and world class enablement and training (check out Trailhead.com for a sneak peek!).
Look after others with seven paid days off to volunteer per year! The successes in giving back have helped us and our Trailblazer community become a leader in philanthropy, culture, and innovation. We are one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies , according to Forbes, we are #1 in PEOPLE’s Top 50 Companies that Care , and are on Fortune’s Change the World list. Values create value.

Sandfield,4.2,Software Developer - Origin,Auckland,"Be part of a leading tech business that develops supply chain engines for some of Australasia’s biggest brandsWork on projects where you’re actually trusted and empowered to make meaningful change for some of Australasia’s leading logistics companies?Be part of a team that focuses on getting the job done and having a good time while doing it?We’re Origin, part of the Kiwi-owned and operated software business, Sandfield, and we build super-smart supply chain software solutions that make a big difference to some big brands.We’re working on some pretty ‘meaty’ projects right now and there’s plenty more in our pipeline...so we need more talented Software Developers to join our awesome team.*About us*Our parent company, Sandfield, has built a formidable reputation for developing innovative software solutions for clients, and has been punching well above its weight, since it opened its doors in 1989.As a company, we pride ourselves on NOT being a conventional tech company. In fact, we like to push the boundaries of what’s possible in everything we do.The Origin supply chain team helps clients get a complete view of their supply chain operations to give them a competitive edge.Our software facilitates high performance supply chains for the likes of Mainfreight, Qube and Allied Concrete just to name a few.Your job will be to help us develop bespoke tech solutions that help our clients load, ship, transport and deliver to their customers expectations at the same time as providing better visibility of what’s going on in their supply chain than ever before.Our pitch to youWe know it’s a competitive market out there and loads of other companies are also probably trying to ‘woo’ you right now with big numbers and equally big promises.What we can offer is something a little more special.Our developers get to deal directly with our clients and we spend just as much time nurturing soft skills, such as communication and business acumen, as we do helping our developers be even more ‘ninja’ at their coding.We guarantee your ‘everyday’ will be interesting, varied, challenging and fun! You’ll get to work alongside a range of other smart developers of all levels, who also happen to be really great people too.They’re mountain bikers, road bikers, skiers, runners, active relaxers, video gamers, animal lovers, movie buffs, gym buffs, foodies, wine critics, bakers and musicians.

Be involved in creative and innovative projects that make a positive difference to the lives of New Zealanders
We’re searching for a creative and innovative Senior Experience Designer to bring their design expertise to our Wellington based team. We want someone curious and collaborative, who’s comfortable turning complex scenarios into seamless and beautiful user experiences that create lasting impact.
In this role, you will be translating high level ideas into unique design directions, and developing digital solutions that are not only visually beautiful, human and emotive but also inventive, daring and brave.
You’ll be able to balance technical and organisational constraints and objectives, with diverse user needs, while effortlessly applying design patterns, brand guidelines and design thinking across multiple projects. You’ll do this while working collaboratively with developers and testers to implement and adapt responsive, accessible designs.
You’ll be an advocate for the principles of ‘good design’, illustration and functionality and know how to unravel complexity in order to produce solutions that are desirable and easy to use. You’ll support this with sound, evidence-based rationale and validated assumptions - and be continually iterating and improving designs as you go.
At Alphero, we support our people to take their careers to the next level with a built-in growth framework that includes mentoring, training, R&D opportunities as well as learning and discovery through our Ideas Factory Innovation Programme.
If you’re ready to help shape the digital future, we’d love to hear from you.

We don’t sweat the small stuff - everyone works with the latest gadgets, tools and technologies. Tell us what you need to make your work easier.
Our clients - and their customers - come from every sector and all walks of life, and so do we. We hire talented, passionate people, and together we create strong teams that enable us to reach exceptional outcomes. You’ll help keep the team aligned with your ability to tell a compelling story.

Alphero Limited,4.0,Senior iOS Developer,Wellington,"About Alphero
At Alphero we create some of the most impactful digital services in New Zealand - from government agencies seeking to deliver equitable services to all of the people of Aotearoa, to large businesses looking to disrupt themselves. Or with a few out-there funded start-ups doing seriously interesting things.
We are on a mission to create equitable digital experiences; and to envision new digital products that aren’t just wonderful, but challenge the status quo, and become the benchmark for digital in our future world. In order to do this we believe we need to connect heart and purpose, break conventions; and approach problems and opportunities with teamwork, unorthodox thinking, a creative and inventive mindset, and a growing kitbag of skills and enablers.
At Alphero we have a fun, friendly, collaborative environment where diversity and individuality are welcomed, and everyone is heard. Take a seat at the Alphero kitchen table and get to know the team. Everyone works with the latest gadgets, tools and technologies. We give you the tools you need to do the job. Flexible working is a given.
Requirements
About You (and The Role)
This is where you come in. Good outcomes require quality delivery. As one of our senior iOS developers you will be part of (and learn from) a great team of mobile specialists. You will collaborate with our amazing clients, fabulous designers, laser-eyed testers, and super organised PMs to craft digital products that you can be genuinely proud of. You will get to work with modern tech stacks and frameworks, in an environment where curiosity and continuous improvement are actively encouraged.
As a senior developer, you will have 5 years as an iOS developer working on mobile solutions (or 5 solid years as a developer, with at least 2 doing iOS). You could either be someone who really wants to refine your specialist skills to become a solid expert at senior; or your pathway is to technical lead (on a product), solutions architect or team lead.
If you would like to do more than build elegant software - but define its technical and architectural direction - we are growing the number of technical leads at Alphero. We will provide the opportunities, coaching and support for you to grow into that next best version of yourself. You will enjoy not just being mentored, but the opportunity to mentor others, with the goal for you to lead small teams of developers on a project.
If this feels like you, or you'd like to find out more. Get in touch. We'll provide you with more information about the role, and a pack about benefits, and working life at Alphero.
