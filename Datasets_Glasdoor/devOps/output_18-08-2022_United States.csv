Imperfect Foods,3.0,DevOps Engineer,Remote,"About Imperfect:
Founded in 2015, Imperfect Foods, a Certified B CorporationTM (B CorpTM), is the leading online grocer at the forefront of eliminating food waste and building a better food system. We work directly with farmers and producers to rescue, redistribute, and develop goods across multiple grocery categories, and to date have rescued more than 150 million pounds of food from lesser outcomes. Our customers enjoy a customizable service that is more affordable and more environmentally friendly than the average trip to the grocery store.
Mission:
At Imperfect Foods, we're on a mission to eliminate food waste and build a better food system for everyone.
Net Zero Carbon Commitment:
Imperfect Foods pledged to become a net-zero carbon operation by 2030. To do that, we’re working to optimize every part of our business operations and supply chain to mitigate waste, and are switching to 100% renewable energy in our fulfillment centers and vehicle fleet by 2027.
Please consider completing the optional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) survey below. Doing so will help keep us accountable for the DEI commitments we have made as a company. By choosing to disclose elements of your identity, you are informing us about our candidate pool and the ways we can continue to improve making Imperfect Foods an inclusive company for everyone. Responses will in no way affect your candidacy for the position you apply for. Information collected will be kept secure and confidential and will be used solely to evaluate our DEI efforts. We thank you in advance for helping us to become a better company for people of all backgrounds.
About the Role:
The software engineering team builds the eCommerce platform and internal tooling that supports our mission to eliminate food waste and build a kinder food system.

We have heaps of interesting problems to solve around customer experience, logistics, supply chain, and scale. We’re looking for a DevOps engineer to support the overall engineering team as they help us take the work out of grocery shopping by building delightfully functional web and mobile experiences.
Our technology stack currently consists of React on the frontend and a mix of Node and F# in a microservices backend. We’re on a TypeScript migration journey for all JavaScript code. Data persistence is handled by PostgreSQL and Snowflake, and messages by RabbitMQ. Recently, our customer-facing application has been released as iOS and Android apps. We believe in building expertise in a relatively small set of modern but mature tools. We’re a remote-first team with members throughout the US.
If owning the full product engineering lifecycle, sustainability, preventing food waste, and working daily with a bunch of pleasant people excites you, come join us!
This role will report to the DevOps Manager and can be remotely located within US time zones.
You should have the technical skills to work directly with AWS and test suites, and the communication skills to educate others and help to institute a culture of quality.

Nautilus Labs,NA,DevOps Engineer,"New York, NY","About Nautilus.

Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable.

Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.

GovOS,2.4,Entry Level DevOps Engineer,"Austin, TX","Company Description
At GovOS, we believe that government’s potential to do good is largely measured by how quickly they respond to and accommodate citizen needs, both online and off. Evolving out of 30+ years of providing public sector services, GovOS has been built with the mission to accelerate the digital transformation of government. We are committed to being exceptional partners with agencies nationwide as we work together to bridge the growing gap between the analog and digital ages.

Job Description
Work in a cloud operations department that practices a DevOps philosophy. Code isn't thrown over a wall from Development to Operations. Instead, Ops works closely with Dev from before development begins to create efficient, reliable, and cost-effective software. The ideal candidate for this role will strive to exemplify our company core values in all that he/she does: “Own It”, “No Day Wasted”, “Customer Centric”, “Together We Win”, and “Purpose Driven”.
Responsibilities and Duties
Create productive developer workflows (especially using automation)
Design and maintain shared production, development and testing environments
Build and maintain code deployment systems
Respond to on-call emergency response.

Qualifications
Applicant will have extensive experience with:
Administering at least one of Linux, Unix, Windows
Writing with any scripting language (especially Python, shell)
Managing cloud resources (especially AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
Working with configuration management tools (especially Ansible)
Working with continuous Integration tools (especially Jenkins)
Working with metrics tools (especially Prometheus)
Working with graphing tools (especially Grafana)
Moderate experience:
Administering and tuning databases (especially PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
And at least some experience:
Administering at least one of Linux, Unix, Windows
Programming using any programming language
A substantial portion of Operations Department work is customer service (customers are mostly internal to the company). Therefore, a customer-oriented attitude, along with diplomacy and clear communication are strictly required.
We realize almost no one has all of the experience listed above; that's okay. Foundational knowledge plus desire & ability to learn are at least as important as experience.
Additional Information
Benefits:
As a full-time employee, you will receive access to the following benefits
Leadership and career development opportunities
Low cost insurance (medical, dental, vision, life & disability)
