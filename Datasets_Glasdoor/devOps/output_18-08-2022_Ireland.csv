COVID-19 Considerations
We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.
In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.
Corporate Security Responsibility
All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must:
Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines. Our Purpose
We work to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere by making transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible. Using secure data and networks, partnerships and passion, our innovations and solutions help individuals, financial institutions, governments and businesses realize their greatest potential. Our decency quotient, or DQ, drives our culture and everything we do inside and outside of our company. We cultivate a culture of inclusion for all employees that respects their individual strengths, views, and experiences. We believe that our differences enable us to be a better team – one that makes better decisions, drives innovation and delivers better business results.

Workday,4.3,Software Engineer (Devops),Dublin,"Do what you love. Love what you do.
At Workday, we help the world’s largest organizations adapt to what’s next by bringing finance, HR, and planning into a single enterprise cloud. We work hard, and we’re serious about what we do. But we like to have fun, too. We put people first, celebrate diversity, drive innovation, and do good in the communities where we live and work.
About the Team
We prioritise career growth, learning and collaboration. Employees are our #1 value!

We are an agile organisation, constantly looking for ways to improve our customer solutions with high value deliveries. We embrace diversity which we believe gives our customers the best results. We are inclusive in the way we work - anyone can propose improvements, we help each other out, and we share in each others' successes.

Our department, Customer Deployment Tools (CDT), builds a tooling suite for both new and existing Workday customers. CDT's mission is to enable easy adoption of Workday to help businesses achieve transformational change. We strive to streamline and simplify the deployment experience, so that implementers and customers are maximally effective, Workday is more competitive, and our customers start off on the right foot.

We are the DevOps team within CDT. Our mission is to enable CDT developers to achieve a fast, simple and reliable delivery of value, reduce the cost of ownership and provide early feedback to support data-driven decisions. We care about the developer experience as much as about the products they deliver to Workday customers, and work to provide safe and sustainable development environments, supporting CI/CD tools and practices.

In order to achieve this, we build easy-to-use, self-service, opinionated, open-source solutions that encourage collaboration, and provide easy access to a reliable delivery infrastructure.
About the Role
We are looking for a software engineer who understands the process of software development, the agile philosophy and DevOps principles, and looks to improve and optimize them for their fellow engineers. This is a small team with a large influence not just within CDT but also on other parts of the company, as our tools have been adopted by other organizations and teams.
Basic qualifications:
Solid experience with object oriented languages and data structures.
Good working knowledge of Git and Linux.
Other qualifications:
Some experience building CI/CD pipelines.
Some experience with containers and cloud infrastructure.
About You
You are a great teammate, collaborative, outspoken and fun to work with. You are willing to run internal projects and promote them outside the team, for example doing build guild presentations or networking with similar teams. You care about the solutions that you deliver, about their quality and about the development process.

SoftwareONE,4.0,Senior DevOps Engineer,Dublin,"Job Function: Goatpath Why SoftwareONE?:

About Goatpath
Goatpath is SoftwareONE’s software team that builds platforms and products to automate and govern customers’ software and cloud investments through intuitive products they love to use. We are humble, nimble, focused, always ready to do what’s right, not afraid to take the toughest and unmarked path – this is what Goatpath stands for. Within Goatpath there are currently four product groups: Marketplace, Cloud, Digital and Insights. The Marketplace team aims to be at the top of software, while Cloud seeks to build the most simple and intelligent cloud management platform. Insights will allow customers to benchmark their maturity in the space of spend and technology, while Digital will revolutionize how customers will interact with SoftwareONE. All products are built on a shared platform.
The role:
Management of build/testing infrastructure in Azure DevOps
Troubleshooting and fixing issues in the pipelines but also ensuring best practices are followed
Automation of custom tasks using pipelines, scripting (Powershell, Azure CLI) and .NET
Creating, managing, monitoring and testing resources (e.g. AKS, Keyvaults, Web Application, WAF, etc) in an automated way: using pipelines and scripting (Powershell, Azure CLI) and Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools such as Terraform/Terragrunt to manage all the infrastructure using IaC, considering disaster recovery and multi-region deployments.
Embracing the “Everything-as-Code” philosophy, to automate as much as we can: not only Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Pulumi) and Pipelines-as-Code (YAML pipelines) but also other aspects (security, policies, etc) using tools such as Checkov and Chef InSpec.
What we need to see from you:
Tooling / Technology / Process:
Azure DevOps, Git, build agentsPowerShell, Azure CLI, bashKubernetes/Docker.NET/C#Terraform
IaaS / PaaS / SaaS modelsCI/CD and related methodologies
Setting up and enhancing CI/CD environments
Managing and automating Azure cloud environment
Being part of SoftwareONE means we live and breathe our company’s core values, most of all “Customer Focus” and “Speed”. But being part of the Goatpath team is a little more than that. Every single day we ask ourselves and our team members to:
Be curious, try things out! If you fail, that’s ok – we don’t blame
Embrace change and start with “why not?” instead of “why?”
Prioritize good over perfect – don’t withhold customers from functionality
Leave the ego and office politics at the door
Take ownership
….. and have fun!
