03/09/2022 Heritage is on the lookout for Software Developers with expertise in any of the following areas across our teams in IT: Android (Kotlin), C#/.Net, iOS (Swift), Java, Sitecore or UniVerse.

About the team:

The 2022 roadmap for Information Technology at Heritage is looking action-packed – from a potential merger to core banking migration and Cloud implementation… and much more! Big plans need amazing people to make them happen, and that’s why we are on the lookout for Software Developers across our teams in IT, with expertise in any of the following areas:
Android (Kotlin)
C#/.Net
iOS Development (Swift)
Java
Sitecore
UniVerse
Most of our Developers sit within the IT Operations and Development team: the integration of both Ops and Dev in the same unit is a rare configuration that allows team members the opportunity to participate in end-to-end solution delivery, and to enjoy a breadth of career development prospects that can be hard to come by in many organisations.

About the role:

You’ll create and enhance software solutions which develop new capabilities for the Bank and allow seamless integration with third-party products.
Gather and document requirements to ensure an appropriate solution can be developed to meet the business need
Undertake complex, high-risk software development in accordance with Software Development Lifecycle and Application Security expectations, using appropriate design and integration patterns to deliver secure, stable and maintainable software
Create automated unit test and integration test cases to provide regression testing of the code / solution
Create test plans and execute manual testing to ensure quality and integrity of software as required
Support software running in production to ensure continuity of service to customers and colleague
Maintain up-to-date knowledge on current technologies and trends in the programming language(s) in which you specialise
You will also participate in knowledge-sharing and continuous improvement activities to ensure ongoing functionality, quality and security of systems, business and coding practices, including (but not limited to) design and documentation of APIs, applications and solutions, and peer review of code for other developers.

About you:

You’re a proficient, autonomous programmer and analytical thinker who loves tackling problems with innovative solutions. For ideas and inspiration, you keep abreast of the latest technologies and trends within your area of expertise. You are a ‘lifelong learner’ who enjoys sharing knowledge with your colleagues in order to optimise the overall capability of the team.

You have excellent written and spoken communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to confidently interact with different stakeholders and break down the jargon: explaining what you’re doing in terms that are understandable and relatable to a wide range of audiences.

Required:
Appropriate tertiary qualification(s) in Computer Science, Information Technology, Software Engineering or other relevant field(s)
Strong understanding and significant professional experience in C#, Java, Kotlin, Sitecore, Swift or UniVerse development
Understanding of microservice development and architecture patterns
Understanding of integration patterns and object-oriented design patterns, programming principles and techniques
Experience working in container-based environments, such as Docker or Kubernetes
Desirable:
Banking and financial services industry experience would be highly regarded
Exposure to Red Hat middleware and platform services, such as 3scale, Fuse and OpenShift
Experience in the use of IBM Case Manager, IBM Case Foundation and IBM FileNet Content Manager
If this opportunity sounds appealing but you don’t match every single one of our requirements, we’d still love to hear from you and find out what unique blend of skills, knowledge and attributes you can bring to the team!

Job Title
BizOps Engineer II
Job Description Summary

The BizOps team is looking for a Site Reliability Engineer who can help us solve problems, build our CI/CD pipeline and lead Mastercard in DevOps automation and best practices.

Are you a born problem solver who loves to figure out how something works?
Are you a CI/CD geek who loves all things automation?
Do you have a low tolerance for manual work and look to automate everything you can?
Business Operations is leading the DevOps transformation at Mastercard through our tooling and by being an advocate for change & standards throughout the development, quality, release, and product organizations. We need team members with an appetite for change and pushing the boundaries of what can be done with automation. Experience in working across development, operations, and product teams to prioritize needs and to build relationships is a must.

Mission

The role of business operations is to be the production readiness steward for the platform. This is accomplished by closely partnering with developers to design, build, implement, and support technology services. A business operations engineer will ensure operational criteria like system availability, capacity, performance, monitoring, self-healing, and deployment automation are implemented throughout the delivery process. Business Operations plays a key role in leading the DevOps transformation at Mastercard through our tooling and by being an advocate for change and standards throughout the development, quality, release, and product organizations.

We accomplish this transformation through supporting daily operations with a hyper focus on triage and then root cause by understanding the business impact of our products. The goal of every biz ops team is to shift left to be more proactive and upfront in the development process, and to proactively manage production and change activities to maximize customer experience, and increase the overall value of supported applications. Biz Ops teams also focus on risk management by tying all our activities together with an overarching responsibility for compliance and risk mitigation across all our environments. A biz ops focus is also on streamlining and standardizing traditional application specific support activities and centralizing points of interaction for both internal and external partners by communicating effectively with all key stakeholders.

Ultimately, the role of biz ops is to align Product and Customer Focused priorities with Operational needs. We regularly review our run state not only from an internal perspective, but also understanding and providing the feedback loop to our development partners on how we can improve the customer experience of our applications.

Responsibilities

Engage in and improve the whole lifecycle of services—from inception and design, through deployment, operation and refinement.
Analyze ITSM activities of the platform and provide feedback loop to development teams on operational gaps or resiliency concerns
Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, capacity planning and launch reviews.
Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency and overall system health. Hands on experience on SPLUNK and DYNATRACE to build telemetry around service.
Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like automation, and evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
Support the application CI/CD pipeline for promoting software into higher environments through validation and operational gating, and lead Mastercard in DevOps automation and best practices.
Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems.
Take a holistic approach to problem solving, by connecting the dots during a production event thru the various technology stack that makes up the platform, to optimize mean time to recover
Work with a global team spread across tech hubs in multiple geographies and time zones
Share knowledge and mentor junior resources
Qualifications

BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding (e.g., physics or mathematics), or equivalent practical experience.
Experience with algorithms, data structures, scripting, pipeline management, and software design.
Systematic problem-solving approach, coupled with strong communication skills and a sense of ownership and drive.
Ability to help debug and optimize code and automate routine tasks.
We support many different stakeholders. Experience in dealing with difficult situations and making decisions with a sense of urgency is needed.

REA Group,4.3,Senior Developer,Melbourne,"We're REA
An Australian start-up success story we're quietly proud of.
From a garage in Melbourne to the global stage is an achievement we're humbled by. Our idea to put pictures of houses on the internet has blossomed since 1995, and we now have businesses across Australia, India and North America.
Our purpose is to change the way the world experiences property. No matter where you're at on your property journey, we're here to help on every step - whether that's buying, selling, renting or renovating.
Some of our brands include realestate.com.au, realcommercial.com.au, Flatmates.com.au, Proptrack.com, Smartline.com.au and Mortgage Choice.
We’re proud to have been named one of Australia’s Best Workplaces for 2021. This recognition is a great proof point of our unique and special culture. A culture that is driven by our people, our values, and our commitment to making a difference in the community.
What we’re doing
With us, you’ll experience Impact. This role sits within Consumer Membership & Property. The Stack Stars squad has end-to-end responsibility for the Personalisation Stack as well as onboarding teams from across REA on their Personalisation journey. The goal of Personalisation is to deliver features to the realestate.com.au website & mobile experience that engage users beyond the traditional property purchase and sale events REA is so well known for.

You will be working collaboratively with our product and technical team members to help deliver an event driven architecture that supports REA’s personalisation stack. The Senior Developer supports the team in the following ways:
Designing, implementing new or uplifting existing data pipelines and APIs using Scala, as well as data platform technology such as Kafka, Apache Flink, BigQuery and Airflow.
Maintaining and supporting production systems and users in different capacities (custodianship, business hours pager, help channel requests).
Onboarding the rest of the business on our Martech Stack (Braze, Tealium CDP - Customer Data Platform). Collaborating on final design solution and performance test.
Championing quality software delivery from inception and design to build and deployment, in collaboration with our Lead Developer and Technical Lead.

Working with product managers to understand business priorities and communicate technical options, report on progress and express ideas.
Sharing responsibility for all operational aspects of the software that we build, in support of our “you build it; you run it” philosophy where dev-ops is a part of everyday life.
Who we’re looking for
Approximately 5+ years of experience working in software development.
Strong programming skills. We build new systems mainly in Scala, but also own systems in other languages such as Typescript , Java, Ruby and Python, so you should be an expert in one of those and have some familiarity with or willingness to learn others.
Experience in building data pipelines. Working with streaming data frameworks, such as Kafka and Apache Flink is a bonus.
Experience with modern software development techniques such as test-driven development, microservice architecture, functional programming, and continuous delivery.
Exposure to dev-ops and cloud engineering tools and techniques is a plus, particularly AWS, GCP, containers, infrastructure-as-code and BuildKite
Proven experience as a senior team member influencing architectural and delivery outcomes.
Proven operational experience resolving critical incidents in cloud production environments.
Excellent communication skills and experience coaching other team members.
Work productively in a fast paced and agile environment
Able to lead and deliver slices of work.
But we don’t just look for someone based on their skills and expertise. It’s our connection, acceptance and genuine care for each other that makes REA a great place to work. That means you also need to be:
Savvy minded and have curiosity to think a little left of field / outside the box
A strong and creative communicator
Friendly, approachable and have good relationship management skills
An avid contributor to our inclusive culture - we celebrate different perspectives and all play an active role in creating a sense of belonging
The REA experience

Oh, and by the way:
At REA we value diversity and inclusion in all forms. Gender, religion, ethnicity, LBTGIQ+, neurodiversity and so much more. Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you've got the must-haves, dedication and enthusiasm to learn but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.

The goal of Personalisation is to deliver features to the realestate.com.au website & mobile experience that engage users beyond the traditional property purchase and sale events REA is so well known for.

You will be working collaboratively with our product and technical team members to help deliver an event driven architecture that supports REA’s personalisation stack. The Senior Developer supports the team in the following ways:
Designing, implementing new or uplifting existing data pipelines and APIs using Scala, as well as data platform technology such as Kafka, Apache Flink, BigQuery and Airflow.
Maintaining and supporting production systems and users in different capacities (custodianship, business hours pager, help channel requests).
Onboarding the rest of the business on our Martech Stack (Braze, Tealium CDP - Customer Data Platform). Collaborating on final design solution and performance test.
Championing quality software delivery from inception and design to build and deployment, in collaboration with our Lead Developer and Technical Lead.

Who we’re looking for
Approximately 5+ years of experience working in software development.
Strong programming skills. We build new systems mainly in Scala, but also own systems in other languages such as Typescript , Java, Ruby and Python, so you should be an expert in one of those and have some familiarity with or willingness to learn others.
Experience in building data pipelines. Working with streaming data frameworks, such as Kafka and Apache Flink is a bonus.
Experience with modern software development techniques such as test-driven development, microservice architecture, functional programming, and continuous delivery.
Exposure to dev-ops and cloud engineering tools and techniques is a plus, particularly AWS, GCP, containers, infrastructure-as-code and BuildKite
Proven experience as a senior team member influencing architectural and delivery outcomes.
Proven operational experience resolving critical incidents in cloud production environments.
Excellent communication skills and experience coaching other team members.

Who are We?

At Target, we’ve always been here to help families live better. But right now, we can see that what ‘better’ means is changing. Better means making choices that can change the world. Better is about a life that’s lived, not with more things, but with things that mean more. A life where quality is always valued over quantity. Where beauty is born from style and substance in equal measure. A better way of life, that’s within easy reach of all. That’s why everything from the products we make to the experience we create, is crafted with intention and a single purpose…To inspire families to live better.

Employee Job Description
One team. Global challenges. Infinite opportunities. At Viasat, we’re on a mission to deliver connections with the capacity to change the world. For more than 35 years, Viasat has helped shape how consumers, businesses, governments and militaries around the globe communicate. We’re looking for people who think big, act fearlessly, and create an inclusive environment that drives positive impact to join our team.
Responsibilities
Our team is developing the gateway signal processing software for Viasat's third-generation, global satellite internet network. “Viasat-3,” our revolutionary GEO satellite, is unprecedented both in its terabit per second capacity and its flexibility in directing that capacity where it is needed in real-time. Viasat-3 Flight 1 will cover the Americas upon its launch in 2022, and Flights 2 and 3 will subsequently cover the Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia/Pacific regions. These spacecraft require an equally innovative gateway architecture, and we are developing an ultra-high throughput GPU-based modem to that end. Our team is responsible for its design, implementation, integration, and test.

Just Digital People,4.5,This DevOps advert is to the tune of Vanilla Ice... MUST READ. Dev Ops Baby,Melbourne,"Read to the tune of Vanilla Ice - Ice Ice Baby

Yo, VIP, Let's kick it!!!!

Dev Dev Baby, Ops Ops Baby

All right stop, collaborate with dev and listen
Ops is back with my brand new invention
DevOps grabs a hold of you tightly
Then you flow like powershell daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo - I don't know
Turn off the containers and I'll blow
To the extreme, you rock AWS like a vandal
Deploy to the cloud continuously like a scandal.

Dance
DevOps is the market that booms
Your testing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when you write a dope bash script
Anything less than cloud strategy is a felony
Love it or leave it, You better terraform
You better hit bull's eye, The dev's don't play
If there was a problem, Yo, you'll solve it
Check out this advert while JDP revolves it

Ops Ops Baby Vanilla, Dev Dev Baby... Vanilla
Dev Ops Baby Vanilla, Ops Dev Baby... Vanilla

Now that the business is jumping
With the AWS kicked in, the ec2's are pumpin'
Quick to deploy, to the point no stopping
Your cooking serverless computing like a pound of bacon
Delivering code, if it ain't quick and nimble
You go crazy when you hear a tester
And a chef hat with an AGILE tempo
Your on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in your .NET 5.0
With the containers down so your hair can blow-up
The scrum-master on standby, Waving just to say Hi
Did you stop? No - it's CD, why?

Kept on scripting to the next stop
You bash a left and your heading to the next infrastructure block
That infrastructure was dead

Yo - so you continuously integrated to S3 Beachfront Ave
Puppet was hot wearing less than bikinis
Ruby lovers driving Lamborghinis-onrails
Jealous 'cause you're out making monthly k$9
Agile Coach with a meeting and you with no time
Ready for the employee of the month on the wall
The office acting nice because they're so full of fried chicken balls
Release date ranged out like a bell
You asked your tester - All you hear is a bombshell
Failing on the final test real fast
Jumped your car, slammed on the gas
Melbourne traffic Collins streets packed
Try to get away before you get called back
Team Lead on the scene, You know what I mean
They backed me up, confronted all the **** code fiends
If there was a problem, Yo - you'll solve it
Check out this advert while JDP revolves it

Ops Ops Baby... Vanilla,

Dev Dev Baby... Vanilla
Dev Ops Baby... Vanilla,

Ops Dev Baby... Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause James Farrey a lyrical poet
Melbourne's on the scene for DevOps just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all this career sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in your current works ground
'Cause my style's like a banter bomb spill
Feasible job options that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this role is a hell of a concept
I make it hype and you want to step

With this. You apply via this page

CV like a ninja, cover letter like a razor blade

So good - other clients say, ""damn""
If your skillset was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
When I get you the job it's time to get loose
Expense all the drinks even the juice
If there was a candidate shortage, Yo - I'll solve it!

Now that the business is jumping
With the AWS kicked in, the ec2's are pumpin'
Quick to deploy, to the point no stopping
Your cooking serverless computing like a pound of bacon
Delivering code, if it ain't quick and nimble
You go crazy when you hear a tester
And a chef hat with an AGILE tempo
Your on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in your .NET 5.0
With the containers down so your hair can blow-up
The scrum-master on standby, Waving just to say Hi
Did you stop? No - it's CD, why?

Kept on scripting to the next stop
You bash a left and your heading to the next infrastructure block
That infrastructure was dead

Yo - so you continuously integrated to S3 Beachfront Ave
Puppet was hot wearing less than bikinis
Ruby lovers driving Lamborghinis-onrails
Jealous 'cause you're out making monthly k$9
Agile Coach with a meeting and you with no time
Ready for the employee of the month on the wall
The office acting nice because they're so full of fried chicken balls
Release date ranged out like a bell
You asked your tester - All you hear is a bombshell
Failing on the final test real fast
Jumped your car, slammed on the gas
Melbourne traffic Collins streets packed
Try to get away before you get called back
Team Lead on the scene, You know what I mean
They backed me up, confronted all the **** code fiends
If there was a problem, Yo - you'll solve it

Take heed, 'cause James Farrey a lyrical poet
Melbourne's on the scene for DevOps just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all this career sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in your current works ground
'Cause my style's like a banter bomb spill
Feasible job options that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this role is a hell of a concept
I make it hype and you want to step

With this. You apply via this page

CV like a ninja, cover letter like a razor blade

So good - other clients say, ""damn""
If your skillset was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
When I get you the job it's time to get loose
Expense all the drinks even the juice
If there was a candidate shortage, Yo - I'll solve it!

Yo, VIP, Let's kick it!!!!

Dev Dev Baby, Ops Ops Baby

All right stop, collaborate with dev and listen
Ops is back with my brand new invention
DevOps grabs a hold of you tightly
Then you flow like powershell daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo - I don't know
Turn off the containers and I'll blow
To the extreme, you rock AWS like a vandal
Deploy to the cloud continuously like a scandal.

Dance
DevOps is the market that booms
Your testing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when you write a dope bash script
Anything less than cloud strategy is a felony

About Us
The Digital Solutions team at GenesisCare has a vision to deliver evidence-based care around the world using a common platform to improve patient experience and life outcomes. We do this by building products for Patients, Doctors, Nurses & Radiation Therapists. Our products are built to provide intelligent automated workflows to drive consistency across the treatment journey, we leverage Machine Learning to improve decision support for staff, ultimately with the goal of improving patient’s lives.
Technologies we use
Front-end: Webpack, TypeScript, React, Apollo, GraphQL, SCSS, Styled Components, Jest, Cypress
Backend: Python Django, Graphene, Redis, Redis Streams, Celery, Fast API etc.
Hosting/Ops: AWS, Docker, Terraform, DataDog, Cloud Watch, Sentry, Elastic Cache, Redash
How we work
Teams: Each team consists of 3-5 engineers, a PO and either a BA or a Designer and Clinical Subject Matter expert. Teams are cross-functional, self-organised and most use a flavour of Scrum with a 2-week sprint.
Guilds: Guilds are a place to share knowledge and experiences across tech, product and clinical areas. We have a weekly tech guild/tech reading club and a quarterly clinical guild where we hear from Doctors, Nurses and Patients that use our applications.
Test focused: We like to test the code we build, and we have a continuous integration infrastructure in place that runs our tests on every push.
DevOps mindset: We are cloud first, and everything outside local dev is hosted in AWS. Each team is responsible for deployments and monitoring of their own services. All work is managed through GitHub and Jira.
Privacy and data security: we take our patients’ right to privacy seriously, and are continuously enhancing our practices to achieve this, while supporting our products’ deployments in multiple regions, including the EU and US.
Remote First: We have distributed teams across the UK, USA and Australia. We have a remote first principle and have evolved our team ways of working during the last few years of remote work. Note if you are Sydney based, our team in Sydney do get together once a week at our head office for some good old-fashioned face to face time.

At MaxMine we are developing a new data collection and analytics platform to improve open pit mining operations across the globe. We solve real problems with innovative and tangible solutions that actually stick.
With so much hype in our space, and a solution that delivers real value, our clients can’t get enough of our services, and we need more help to continue delivery and grow our offering.
About Us
Mining operations deal in massive scale operational problems. They ‘lift and shift’ millions of tonnes of material and consume hundreds of millions of dollars per year in operating expenses. A 1% improvement across load and haul fleets can add literally millions to their bottom lines. We are delivering these improvements to our clients across Africa and Australia.
MaxMine is an automated business improvement product which performs advanced analytics and data science on truck operational data to deliver significant cost savings and productivity gains to global miners. We apply engineering science and mathematics to operational data that we collect with our hardware. We store and analyse this data via our cloud platform and deliver results straight into client’s operations.
Our approach is the future of Professional Consulting Services, and everything that we do, and how we do it reflects this. We are a value focused tech company, which happens to work across Operational and Engineering domains in the Mining Services industry. With a growing client base and rapid expansion of services, analytics and operations we have a range of interesting projects which will have an impact.
About You
You probably don’t fit many roles… Too much software for an “engineer”, too much engineer for a software developer. We are looking for people that are keen analysts with a flair for programming and development. Are you keen to solve challenging problems on big operational datasets? Not afraid to get your hands dirty in order to deliver a big outcome for clients.
You are a curious person and a problem solver.
You love exploring large datasets, and understand that there is more than one solution to every problem
You tell stories with data
You can convey insights simply and effectively to people of all walks of life.
You like to solve problems once, so that they stay solved.
Other stuff
We have an immediate need for a senior data engineer / analyst / scientist or data savvy engineer to contribute to our engineering analysis team. We are currently seeking expressions of interest from current candidates who have:
A Degree in Engineering or Computer Science degree or similar experience
3-7 years of experience performing data analysis of any sort
Solved real world problems developing algorithms and software
Are ideally proficient with an Object Oriented language such as Python, C#, Java
Attention to detail and following through on solving client’s actual problems
Some exposure to client liaison functions would be highly desirable
A commercial mindset, focused on value for our clients and value for our business
Our Technology
We work with a range of technologies across the full spectrum of dev-ops and data-science. Our platform is based on;
Snowflake, DBT, PowerBI, python, bokeh

You don’t need to know all of the above, but need to be willing and able to learn. There is also scope to bring new technologies to our platform team where they fit within our existing technology and can demonstrate business value.
Our Values
Our team’s cohesion and success draws from a culture of shared values. We are looking for someone who identifies with all of the following to ensure they are a good fit for the company and vice versa.
Customer – We play the long game, as one team
Impact – We move the needle for our customers, people & environment
Ubuntu – We believe ‘I am because we are’
Finishing – We celebrate when things are done
Excellence – We take pride in our work. Quality output with a sense of urgency
Playful spirit – We have a good laugh
What We Offer
Lots of chances to learn and grow – you’ll be surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the city, part of a culture which values sharing knowledge every day
A competitive compensation package
A chance to join a rapidly scaling start-up
The opportunity to shape your role, our team and our product Greater Adelaide Area (Hybrid)
