DevOps is a series of practices and processes that are intended to speed up and automate aspects of the processes of developing, testing and releasing software, allowing for the continuous delivery of software and software updates. Whereas previously software would be developed by developers and then passed onto testers to test and go back and forth between them, devOps practices aim to simplify this by integrating these previously separate teams. DevOps engineers are responsible for facilitating this. The role of a devOps engineer combines aspects of a technical role and an IT operations role. While engineers are likely to be involved with coding, and a knowledge of coding languages and principles is required to find problems and build solutions, this is not the primary role of a devOps engineer. More senior engineers are likely to be more involved in the project management and planning side of development.

About Zivame
Zivame was founded in 2011 with the vision to facilitate women to shop uninhibitedly for intimate wear and to make lingerie shopping personalized and convenient. Zivame is now the No. 1 B2C intimate wear brand in India with 55+ retail stores and presence in 1450+ partner stores across India with the mission to be a one-stop destination for every woman’s intimate wear needs. Zivame believes that every woman is unique, and wants to deliver a platform that allows her to browse, discover and shop what she desires.
All the products at Zivame stem from the desire to design something that is a blend of quality, innovation, and comfort. Zivame offers trendy lingerie, activewear, sleepwear, and shapewear in over 3000 + exclusive designs and 100 + sizes catering to women across all body types.
What to expect from Zivame?
Passion
We’re not just an e-commerce company, a women’s wear brand or a retail organization. We are together in solving problems for millions of women in India; and that passion drives everything that we do. It’s that passion that helps us do things by keeping the Indian woman front and center in all of our efforts – from Design to Technology, from Marketing to Logistics and everything in between.
Bias for Action
Being an organization that is growing rapidly comes with a culture where everyone strives for creating business impact in their own roles. This strong Bias for Action is seen at every function in the organization at every level which helps us keep bureaucracy to the minimum, make quick decisions, take our ideas to action and see the impact first-hand. We also recognize great performance when we see it, not just at the annual day.
Cross-functional Collaboration
We strive for holistic outcomes and not in silos. Work takes the shortest path possible and people work across functions, levels, experience seamlessly. That meeting could’ve been an email, which could’ve been a call, which could’ve been an in-person discussion. And…Action!
Transparency
A stand-out tenet of our culture has to be the transparency that’s woven into the fabric of Zivame. We discuss everything openly, have no closed offices, no colleague out-of-bounds and no hidden agenda. Our monthly townhalls, coffees with the CEO, an open feedback culture are just a few things you’ll notice while working with us.

Being the leaders in our category, we’re the trailblazers. The Pathbreakers. We’re a tech-first organization and that manifests itself into everything at Zivame. We solve difficult problems, work on cutting-edge tech and build world-class platforms.

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork.

About us
Funded by top VCs - Accel and Elevation Capital - we are building a LinkedIn + Alibaba kind of platform for small businesses in India to help them grow.

You will have an immense amount of freedom. Empathy is ingrained in Anar’s culture. We value individuality. We don’t allow micromanagement. We aim to keep it fun while we build Anar together.


We are helping small businesses build their digital identity (business profiles are similar to our LinkedIn profiles), helping them stay updated about latest products and trends (today, more products are shared on Anar than on 25 yrs old Indiamart!) and helping them grow their income. Check this tweet by our founder, Nishank.

Ability to give clarity and communicate well with the team, including Product, Backend and Dev-Ops (if and when needed)

Ability to use profiling tools well, getting to root causes of bugs fast

Ability to pick and work on adjacent technologies if and when required (Eg: If the best performance monitoring solution needs a basic firebase setup, that should not be a blocker for you to go ahead and do so)

Knowledge of how to set up relevant test cases

You need to be comfortable working in a remote environment (Good internet connection and availability on phone is required)

Good to have
App Development experience

Experience in Test Driven Development

Ability to tell Product what creates better User Experience, ability to tell frontend what API responses will help the user get a faster load time

Experience in working on a Social Media Product

Good knowledge of Graphs, and their applications

Data-Driven Approach to monitoring


Benefits

DESCRIPTION
The QuantDev team within the FID strategists group support the FID trading desks – Exotics Rates, Hybrids, Inflation, Rates Options & FX – by building pricing and risk models in the production system. In addition, the team also provide daily support desk in day-to-day pricing requests and risk management issues.

Role profile:
We are looking for a technical, hands-on specialist to handle aspects of the testing and release process, and help improve our automated build, release, integration and testing infrastructure for the pricing and risk modelling libraries.

The successful candidate will help to maintain and improve the build, test and configuration automation covering the entire lifecycle across several million lines of C++, java, and scala source code.

This is a challenging and high-profile role because the majority of the fixed income portfolio is valued and risked using these libraries, which are used by many varied applications throughout the firm and have multiple inter-dependencies. This requires that we build the libraries in a consistent manner on multiple different platforms, and integrate them into the varied application landscape, which is itself constantly changing. Our ability to patch, test and release new functionality within hours if not minutes can be critical to our success as a business and the successful candidate will be critical to helping us achieve this.

QUALIFICATIONS
Essential:
Experience with c++ build tools including cmake, premake, make, visual studio devenv/msbuild, and build acceleration tools such as Incredibuild, distcc and ccache
Experience as a build and release, testing, and/or configuration management engineer in linux and windows, including hands-on Jenkins experience
Experience with perforce and git (other SCM systems also ok) including writing of customised scripts (eg in python) for tasks such as promotion and propagation, and standard code quality tools such as sonar, cpplint
