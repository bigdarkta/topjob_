Enable,3.9,DevOps Engineer,"Stratford-upon-Avon, England","About Enable:
Market forces are dramatically reshaping supply chains, forcing drastic changes in trading behaviors between manufacturers, distributors and retailers.

At Enable, we believe in removing barriers between trading partners to create a healthier supply chain — and there’s no better way to do this than with rebates. Rebates drive partner behaviors, while increasing loyalty and trust. They help businesses and their trading partners better understand their data, boost their financial performance, mitigate risks, and drive efficiency and trust. When trading partners can make the best decisions for their businesses, everyone wins: manufacturers, distributors, retailers and, most importantly, end consumers.

We insure small businesses and enable big dreams – not just for our customers, but for our people and communities too. With over 850,000 active insurance policies, we protect builders, bakers, landlords, and more than 1,000 other trades.
We harness cutting-edge data ability, believe in experimentation, and build our own technology to deliver better experiences for our customers and employees. This means we’re as much a technology company as one that sells insurance. We build, we fail, we learn, we improve. We’re a B Corp too, which recognises our strong track record of having a positive impact on people, society and the environment.
If Simply Business sounds like the kind of place you’ll thrive, we’d love to hear from you
The DevOps team is responsible for:

You will help bring us closer to our DevOps nirvana and contribute to our Platform as a Service and DevOps culture (test driven infrastructure, automate everything, self-service tooling).
We are product driven, not project driven. Our PaaS built on cloud infrastructure is our product and the rest of the business our customers.
You will be hands on in creating solutions to build and automate environments for production use. You understand the need to build scalable, auditable, reproducible and usable infrastructure. You are security minded and endorse chaos engineering along with the approach of “you build it, you run it” and “you break it, you fix it”.
You will be required to be part of the on call rota, and believe that through well designed systems and automation you will never be called.
We are 100% hosted at AWS (and annually attend re:Invent) have built a PaaS on top to allow our product teams to deploy their applications using a Codebuild / GitHib Actions/Docker/Ansible/Terraform driven, region agnostic, blue-green automated deployment pipeline; this offers both AMIs and Docker images for deployment to our respective AWS EC2 and ECS production environment
In front of this we offer a self-service load balancing solution along with a DSL-based approach for creating and managing our subdomains with regards to DNS, SSL certificates, traffic manager routing and monitoring.
This framework is all done as Infrastructure as Code including integrations of other AWS services (e.g. RDS, S3), with a focus on providing the guardrails for immutable systems and making it as self-service as possible for the Engineering Teams.

Enable,3.9,DevOps Engineer,"Stratford-upon-Avon, England","About Enable:
Market forces are dramatically reshaping supply chains, forcing drastic changes in trading behaviors between manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Many key business decisions are being made without a single source of truth to back them up, resulting in struggles to keep up with consumer expectations and increased disputes between partners.
At Enable, we believe in removing barriers between trading partners to create a healthier supply chain — and there’s no better way to do this than with rebates. Rebates drive partner behaviors, while increasing loyalty and trust. They help businesses and their trading partners better understand their data, boost their financial performance, mitigate risks, and drive efficiency and trust. When trading partners can make the best decisions for their businesses, everyone wins: manufacturers, distributors, retailers and, most importantly, end consumers.

Work with other engineers, providing the knowledge to deliver a smooth automation process from the start to the end of the project lifecycle.
Help maintain Infrastructure as Code, alongside Docker & Azure Container ecosystem
Accountable for meeting the SLA’s and KPI’s defined for the applications on the Azure platform.
Must Haves:
Strong understanding of Cloud technology – specifically Azure.
Knowledge of IAM stack, including identity, authentication, and federation.
Experience working in a highly available production environment.

Experience integrating test automation frameworks into CI/CD pipelines, coalescing results, and delivering data for decision making.

Please speak to the Talent Acquisition team for more info. We're keen to meet people with varied backgrounds - our view is the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

We want to build teams which represent a variety of experiences, perspectives and skills, and we recognise talent on the basis of merit and potential. We understand some people may not apply for jobs unless they tick every box.

If you're excited about joining us and think you have much of what we're looking for, even if you're not 100% sure… we'd love to hear from you. Learn more about working in Kaluza on our careers page and LinkedIn. Job title: DevOps / Production Engineer

Location: London, Bristol, Edinburgh (including hybrid)

Salary: £62,500 - £91,500

Kaluza wants to power a world where net-zero is within everyone's reach, by building the platform that will accelerate a sustainable, affordable and resilient energy transition. It's a huge challenge, but often the toughest problems are the most rewarding to solve.

Since launching in 2019, Kaluza's technology has been empowering some of the biggest energy suppliers to better serve millions of customers.

From revolutionising billing to smart electric vehicle charging, our real-time cloud platforms transform supplier operations, reducing cost to serve and boosting engagement. And most importantly, they enable suppliers' customers to drive decarbonisation with smart, low carbon technologies.

Where in the world of Kaluza will I be working?

You'll be joining the technology area of Kaluza. We are a large team of both data-led and product focused Software and Production Engineers, pushing the boundaries of technology working at an outstanding scale. As a collective we strive for engineering greatness and ensuring best practices across the board of the engineering community.

As a Production Engineer you will join one of our Engineering teams, with the mission to ensure our software engineering teams have the right conditions to build and operate high-performance, reliable, secure & scalable systems. You'll provide mentorship, implementation and guidance on improvements to infrastructure and observability across teams at Kaluza.

This is a varied role where you'll be exposed to the full technology stack and will work across projects spanning deployment & infrastructure automation, SRE, performance engineering, release engineering and monitoring distributed systems, all with close collaboration with engineering teams.

Our Platform teams build software tools, infrastructure and automation that are reusable across many software teams while being reliable for the future. This enables us to scale the freedom and autonomy Kaluza's engineering culture is built upon.
