Firmex,4.8,DevOps Engineer (Remote),Toronto,"You won’t ever be bored here. At Firmex we solve interesting problems using awesome technologies in really radical ways.
Firmex is a global software-as-a-service provider with corporate headquarters in Toronto, Canada. The company’s Firmex VDR product is the world’s most trusted virtual data room, having been used by over 140,000 companies worldwide to share confidential documents for due diligence, litigation and compliance.
Firmex is currently operating 100% remotely during the pandemic. Once it is safe to do so, you will have the flexibility to work in the office or continue to work from home...or a mix of both!
Mission: We’re on a mission to become the number one virtual data room provider in the world, and thanks to our team, we’re well on our way. If you’re curious, motivated, love to solve interesting problems, and take pride in helping clients, we should talk.
Our tech, our stack.

It takes a pretty impressive design, powered by an even more impressive tech stack and supported by an awesome infrastructure to do this.
Our DevOps Engineers use AWS services like: EC2, RDS, API Gateway, S3, VPC, Route 53, CloudWatch, SNS, IAM, KMS, and SSM. Other tools include Packer, Powershell, Jenkins, Git, Ansible, Octopus Deploy, C#, Nginx and more!
We need a new DevOps Engineer team member who wants to:
Help build deployment pipelines with technologies like AWS SAM and CodeDeploy that enable teams to take their changes to production in a safe and reliable manner.
Be the proactive voice of automation on your team, by looking for opportunities to script manual actions.
Perform production deployments and manage releases so your Agile team can continue to deliver value to our clients.
Be a team player. You know that the success of your Agile teams depends on everyone’s collaboration and support of each other.
Keep security at the forefront. The security of our product is of critical importance and that should guide you in your decision-making process and implementation.
As a member of the on-call team, respond to production issues and outages, participate in post mortem RCA meetings and make suggestions for process and service improvements.
And here’s how we know you are the next DevOps Engineer, you have:
Experience in cloud provisioning with tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform that includes managing and architecting cloud infrastructure systems.
Develop and maintain monitoring systems to ensure that components are operating as designed across all environments.
Core knowledge of Linux & Windows from an administrative perspective: core fundamentals, command-line operations, service monitoring.
Practical programming experience with languages like C# or Python, and scripting experience like with Cake or Powershell.
Nice to have experience with Active Directory, DNS, DHCP services configuration and troubleshooting.
A passion for Agile methodology but the flexibility to think outside the scrum. You can think on your feet, collaborate with your team and others, and you enjoy taking ownership for your work.
A curious nature. You want to understand the process behind the decisions, the why of the design, and the nature of the application. New and shiny things can be fun but you’re interested in learning how new technologies, tools and methodologies would work for us.
A desire to put your best foot forward. You want to be part of a team dedicated to creating and delivering quality software.
Outstanding communication. This is not a heads-down role. You will be working with a team that innovates together, out loud. And you will need to listen, engage, and present to external teams and senior project managers in a confident manner.
Pride. You enjoy your work and getting a job done well. You want to be part of a team that promotes their accomplishments and sees the difference they make.
Note: This is a summary of the duties that are essential to this role and is not an exhaustive list. Firmex reserves the right to add or amend duties as necessary.

At CARFAX Canada, we’re more than just obsessed with cars. We’re obsessed with data and using it to help millions of Canadians buy, sell and maintain cars - but you can learn that on our website. Let’s talk about the sweet perks you’ll get when working here (i.e. what you actually want to know): Some days you’ll be taking in-house leadership training courses, other days you’ll be listening to our employee podcast while eating lunch paid for using an Uber Eats voucher. Grab a seat in the state-of-the-art office in 100 Kellogg Lane and collaborate the day away? What’s that, it’s the summer? Well, the 4-day work weeks have kicked in; enjoy those extra paid days off! Why not use one of your paid volunteer days to give back to your community? What else can we list? Competitive wages, amazing benefits, yearly performance-based bonuses, RRSP matching, health and wellness programs, a literal award-winning culture, parental leave top-ups and all kinds of social events. To top all of this off, every day you get to choose how you get to do meaningful work with incredible people. So, looks like we’re obsessed with a few things here – data and our people!

Port 443 Inc.,4.8,DevOps Engineer,Burlington,"About UsAt Port 443 we work together, laugh together, and eat a lot of donuts together. (Have you seen our Instagram? It’s basically a food blog.) Our products (My Music Staff, TutorBird & AthletaDesk) are always evolving, making for an exciting and dynamic environment. Every day, we’re connecting with our thousands of users all around the world. If you ask them what they love about us, they’ll tell you that we really listen to their needs and go above and beyond to help. Our members are at the heart of everything we do. Their feedback and ideas help shape our products, and at the end of the day, we’re all here because of them……and because of the donuts.About YouYou’re a top-notch DevOps kind of person, with a strong emphasis on “Ops”. You’ve got practical experience with AWS and a passion for cyber security (but you probably don’t like the word “cyber” because… well, it’s just kind of weird). Perhaps you were a developer at one point but switched gears to infrastructure and networking (and still like to toss the developer hat back on every now and again!).You like figuring out bottlenecks in systems and you’re a proactive problem solver. You use your development skills to automate routine tasks and you like defining infrastructure as code. Your interests lie at the intersection of software and infrastructure. You take pride in your work and you hate being on-call, so you work carefully to implement reliable infrastructure. You don’t mind chipping in to solve software and/or infrastructure problems around the office either!You’ve got: Strong understanding of cloud-native operations, technologies, principles, and infrastructure as code3 years of experience with core AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, RDS)3 years of configuration management or software development experience3 years of experience with build automation tools (TeamCity, Maven, or other)Experience writing scripts (e.g. bash, PowerShell, etc.)A diploma or degree in a relevant fieldUnderstanding and familiarity with one or more cyber security frameworks (your choice, come and tell us what you know)Your responsibilities will include: Support, automate and improve our AWS infrastructureWork closely with the development and QA teams to optimize the ongoing CI/CD strategies from source control through to product deliveryPerform security audits and advise on best practices for data securityWorking with external service providers when necessary to ensure smooth email delivery from our SaaS platformAutomate as much as possible (work smart, not hard!)Clearly document all processes and toolsMeet the Team!Dan is the founder & president of the company, so none of us would be here without him! He oversees everything going on at Port 443, and his hands are in a lot of the development projects. He’s the guy who makes sure that everything is always running smoothly. Lately, you can find Dan taking meetings while walking on the office treadmill desk! Fun fact: did you know you can suddenly develop an avocado allergy as an adult? Dan knows!Ken is our Project Manager, keeping our many tasks on track and projects running smoothly! He’s always looking for ways to improve our processes and make things as efficient as possible for the team. He’s also always looking for ways to put a smile on your face – stop by Ken’s office in the morning to say hi and you’re pretty much guaranteed to have a great day. When looking at his impressive resume you might think he’s done it all, but one thing still left on his bucket list is to visit the Arctic and see the Northern Lights!Marc once let us decide the fate of his haircut using a Slack poll and shaved his head! As a member of the back-end development team, he’s working on all the things “under the hood” that keep our products running. He’s always got the perfect thing to share in the #random channel, whether it’s his quarantine needlefelt animals or the adorable videos of his pets.Nicolas is another member of the front-end development team – we have a Vick and a Nick, so now we need a Rick! He’s focused on programming the logic that goes along with the design… and fixing the third-party text editor again when we find another bug. He’s a competitive and talented gamer – he won first place in our inaugural company Mario Kart tournament!Ranveer is one of our amazing software developers whose dry sense of humour always brings the laughs around the lunch table! Ask anyone at the office to describe him and they’d say “Ranveezy is a generous guy!” Ask them to expand on that and they would clarify that he shares his advent calendar chocolate with us every year! For a good story, ask him about what happened with the UPS driver and the office door…Shannon is one of our fantastic front-end developers whose curiosity and creativity make her a joy to work with! A lover of music, she’s a secret karaoke master who’d love to learn to play ukelele some day. By day, she’s hard at work helping the team upgrade our products to the next level, but by night she loves to go home, unwind, and enjoy some delicious comfort food. (Her preference? Pierogies)Thomas’ skills as a developer means he can jump between working on the front-end, the back-end, or the servers to help out wherever he’s needed. His hobbies outside of work include everything cool you could possibly think of. Cooking? His IG looks like a professional chef’s. DIY? He can build just about anything. Swords?! YESVick is our Star Wars enthusiast and diehard fan of Toronto-based sports teams! As a member of the front-end development team, he’s focused on making sure that our apps look and work like they’re supposed to. In his spare time, Vick can be found watching hockey, playing hockey (NHL game series or good ol’ fashioned street hockey), reading books about hockey… look, he really likes hockey okay?!Other Perks/BenefitsFree snacks and coffee – are you Team Hazelnut or Team Regular?Company social events throughout the year – significant others welcome!Cool company swag when we reach milestones – check our IG to see some of our past swagComprehensive health benefits plan – now you can stop putting off that dentist appointment!When you come to work at Port 443, you’re joining a team that balances innovation, excellence, and fun.

About the Opportunity
Due to an exciting period of growth, StandardFusion currently has an opportunity for a DevOps Developer to join our team in Vancouver, BC, on a full-time basis. We were full-time in office pre-COVID, we are in a hybrid environment at this point, we continue to discuss options for when COVID subsides and value input from all members of the team
As our new DevOps Developer you will help to design, deploy and maintain scalable systems and processes to support a rapidly expanding customer base. Some of your responsibilities will include:
Working in development and operations. We're not worried if your skillset is 90/10 on the ops side, 90/10 on the dev side or an even mix. We are looking for someone that can eventually contribute at all levels of the software development lifecycle — from designing, building and testing software all the way through to deploying and owning the code running in production. We understand that's a lot to learn, but we are happy to help in any way possible to get you there!
Bringing a security-first mindset to development and operations. Our business is built on the trust that our customers place in us and our operations team is critical in maintaining that trust. If your first thought when standing up new infrastructure or a new service is ‘What are best practices for securing this', that would be an asset. If your next thought is ‘What are the holes in these best practices and how can I improve them', we'd love to work with you!
Collaborating with other developers, and departments to design and create technical solutions that exceed customer expectations. We believe that collaboration is critical on both the operations side and the development side. We highly value clear and open communication and the ability to give and receive feedback.
Provisioning and maintaining infrastructure. You will assist with provisioning new datacenters, managing internal and external network infrastructure (including DNS), and ensuring that infrastructure is regularly patched and analyzed for other vulnerabilities. Due to the nature of this work, there will be some after-hours and on-call work. It is one of our highest priorities to minimize this type of work, but we want to be transparent that it does sometimes occur.
Automating away toil. We're a quickly scaling company are optimizing our processes for the long-term.. We're looking for someone who sees repetitive work as a pain point that can solved in a much more efficient — and fun! — manner with automation. Experience with things like infrastructure-as-code, configuration-as-code, using managed cloud-services and PowerShell scripting would be an asset.
Managing customer instances. Making sure our customers are happy is critical to us. You will help keep them happy by managing the data they store in our SQL Server databases and configuring advanced third-party integrations including REST APIs and SAML2.0.
Troubleshooting problems and optimizing applications for performance and availability. This includes reviewing structured logs and our observability tooling to help resolve issues in a timely manner and surface performance issues before they become customer impacting.
Maintaining the company culture. We understand that culture isn't just whether or not you would hang out with someone — although getting along and enjoying each other's company is an important aspect of it. We also promote a culture of continuous learning, psychological safety and pride of ownership. We're looking for a team player who enjoys collaborating with, learning from, mentoring, and teaching other team members to create a positive work environment.
Helping us grow. We need someone who's willing to go the extra mile and help to generate ideas, solve problems and grow with the company. Add to the discussion, take on your own projects, and see how you can impact the overall business.

About the Opportunity
Due to an exciting period of growth, StandardFusion currently has an opportunity for a DevOps Developer to join our team in Vancouver, BC, on a full-time basis. We were full-time in office pre-COVID, we are in a hybrid environment at this point, we continue to discuss options for when COVID subsides and value input from all members of the team
As our new DevOps Developer you will help to design, deploy and maintain scalable systems and processes to support a rapidly expanding customer base. Some of your responsibilities will include:
Working in development and operations. We're not worried if your skillset is 90/10 on the ops side, 90/10 on the dev side or an even mix. We are looking for someone that can eventually contribute at all levels of the software development lifecycle — from designing, building and testing software all the way through to deploying and owning the code running in production. We understand that's a lot to learn, but we are happy to help in any way possible to get you there!
Bringing a security-first mindset to development and operations. Our business is built on the trust that our customers place in us and our operations team is critical in maintaining that trust. If your first thought when standing up new infrastructure or a new service is ‘What are best practices for securing this', that would be an asset. If your next thought is ‘What are the holes in these best practices and how can I improve them', we'd love to work with you!
Collaborating with other developers, and departments to design and create technical solutions that exceed customer expectations. We believe that collaboration is critical on both the operations side and the development side. We highly value clear and open communication and the ability to give and receive feedback.
Provisioning and maintaining infrastructure. You will assist with provisioning new datacenters, managing internal and external network infrastructure (including DNS), and ensuring that infrastructure is regularly patched and analyzed for other vulnerabilities. Due to the nature of this work, there will be some after-hours and on-call work. It is one of our highest priorities to minimize this type of work, but we want to be transparent that it does sometimes occur.
Automating away toil. We're a quickly scaling company are optimizing our processes for the long-term.. We're looking for someone who sees repetitive work as a pain point that can solved in a much more efficient — and fun! — manner with automation. Experience with things like infrastructure-as-code, configuration-as-code, using managed cloud-services and PowerShell scripting would be an asset.
Managing customer instances. Making sure our customers are happy is critical to us. You will help keep them happy by managing the data they store in our SQL Server databases and configuring advanced third-party integrations including REST APIs and SAML2.0.
