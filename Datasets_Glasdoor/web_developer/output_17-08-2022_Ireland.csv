Etsy,4.6,"Software Engineer, International Experience",Dublin,"Company Description
Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. Etsy, Inc.'s 'house of brands' portfolio has expanded to now include four individually distinct ecommerce brands - Etsy, fashion resale marketplace Depop, musical instrument marketplace Reverb, and Brazil-based handmade goods marketplace Elo7. As an Etsy employee, you'll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.

Job Description
What’s the role?
Our International Experience product group is looking for Software Engineers to collaborate in building trustworthy software and outstanding user experiences. There are diverse and varying disciplines within our group. We are looking for talented and driven people to join the Etsy family and take our vision of “Making Etsy Safe Globally” to the next level.
Here’s a taste of the problems we’re solving:
How can we make it safer and simpler for sellers to run their shops?
How do we ensure the buyer experience is localised to where you are shopping or selling from?
Diversifying the methods of Payments we allow for our checkout experience.
Ensuring that our sellers “are who they say they are” to make purchases even safer.
How can we ensure that every Etsy product developer can reach a global audience in their language and with their cultural expectations?
This is a full-time position reporting to the Senior Engineering Manager, New Markets. This role requires your presence in Etsy’s Dublin office in an in-person or flex capacity. Learn more about our Flex and Office-based work modes as well as vaccination policy here.
What does the day-to-day look like?
You will contribute at all levels of our web application stack, ranging from front-end web interfaces (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React) to back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL, BigQuery). We do not expect you to have complete expertise of our stack before you join us; we all learn on the job.
Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.

Qualifications
Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:
You have experience working on a large scale, high performance and fault-tolerant systems.
You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify.
You care as much about building phenomenal products as you do writing great code.
You have a “leave it better than you found it” mentality, and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write.
Have a knack for organization and breaking down large problems into smaller ones.
Can be autonomous and a fast learner.
You are a mindful, transparent, and communicative member of your team.
Can spin yarns about how you've done this right and wrong at your previous job(s). And we'll give bonus points if you can actually spin yarn.
Enjoy learning about and interacting with the people who use your product.
Additional Information

What's Next
If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you've hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don't want you to be like everyone else - we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you're all about.
Our Promise
At Etsy, we believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us a more relevant, more competitive, and more resilient company. We encourage people from all backgrounds, ages, abilities, and experiences to apply. Etsy is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital or family status, disability, gender, gender identity or expression, pregnancy or caregiver status, veteran status, or any other legally protected status. We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to participate in the job application and interview process, to perform essential job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. While Etsy supports visa sponsorship, sponsorship opportunities may be limited to certain roles and skillsets.
For U.S. roles only:
Many Etsy roles are open to remote candidates, and you'll be able to identify which ones within the location header of each job description.
