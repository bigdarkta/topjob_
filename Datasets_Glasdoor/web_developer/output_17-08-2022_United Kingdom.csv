Summary
Use your Tech superpowers to help shape our environment for future generations.

Ofgem is at the heart of UK life. As the regulator for the energy industry, we are tasked with ensuring that there is a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply for the nation, with the right storage facilities and infrastructure in place to realise this ambition. Now, more than ever, our work is under intense scrutiny. Rising bills are understandably a deep concern for everyone, and as such, it is vital that we have an innovative team in place to help us secure our goals of achieving a Net Zero energy system by 2050.

You will find plenty of opportunity to learn and make best use of new technologies as you deliver digital solutions. With the support from a supportive manager and experienced team will be comfortable working at pace as you provide a technical and application perspective to every challenge, making recommendations on how we could improve. From identifying and fixing bugs to writing code and working with build and release pipelines, you will take technical ownership at every stage of our business application requirements.

This is a great opportunity to further your knowledge in a highly collaborative environment. We’re looking for full-stack capability in technologies including MS .NET (C#), SQL Server Development, and ASP.Net MVC. You must be an accomplished debugger of faults, and have a sound understanding of Object-Oriented Design. Some experience of writing unit and integration tests, continuous integration, build and deployment automation and /or API development would be a definite asset, as would knowledge of SOLID development techniques and design patterns. Strong candidates will also be familiar with one or more of Microservices, .NetCore, Entity Framework and Dependency Injection; and experience of writing SQL for commands and software development would set the best candidates apart.
Candidates must bring excellent work planning, time management, and change management skills, and must be comfortable prioritising (and sometimes reprioritising) their workload. In return you’ll be joining a great team which prides itself on developing and supporting new talent.
We know we achieve our best work when we have a broad cross section of opinions and skills within our team. We therefore welcome candidates from all backgrounds, and especially welcome individuals from underrepresented groups. While this is a full-time role, flexible working patterns and job shares are welcome, so we will see to it that you are able to achieve the work-life balance that is best suited to your lifestyle commitments. We will also provide you with a generous benefits package.

Summary
Use your Tech superpowers to help shape our environment for future generations.

Ofgem is at the heart of UK life. As the regulator for the energy industry, we are tasked with ensuring that there is a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply for the nation, with the right storage facilities and infrastructure in place to realise this ambition. Now, more than ever, our work is under intense scrutiny. Rising bills are understandably a deep concern for everyone, and as such, it is vital that we have an innovative team in place to help us secure our goals of achieving a Net Zero energy system by 2050.

You will find plenty of opportunity to learn and make best use of new technologies as you deliver digital solutions. With the support from a supportive manager and experienced team will be comfortable working at pace as you provide a technical and application perspective to every challenge, making recommendations on how we could improve. From identifying and fixing bugs to writing code and working with build and release pipelines, you will take technical ownership at every stage of our business application requirements.

This is a great opportunity to further your knowledge in a highly collaborative environment. We’re looking for full-stack capability in technologies including MS .NET (C#), SQL Server Development, and ASP.Net MVC. You must be an accomplished debugger of faults, and have a sound understanding of Object-Oriented Design. Some experience of writing unit and integration tests, continuous integration, build and deployment automation and /or API development would be a definite asset, as would knowledge of SOLID development techniques and design patterns. Strong candidates will also be familiar with one or more of Microservices, .NetCore, Entity Framework and Dependency Injection; and experience of writing SQL for commands and software development would set the best candidates apart.
Candidates must bring excellent work planning, time management, and change management skills, and must be comfortable prioritising (and sometimes reprioritising) their workload. In return you’ll be joining a great team which prides itself on developing and supporting new talent.
We know we achieve our best work when we have a broad cross section of opinions and skills within our team. We therefore welcome candidates from all backgrounds, and especially welcome individuals from underrepresented groups. While this is a full-time role, flexible working patterns and job shares are welcome, so we will see to it that you are able to achieve the work-life balance that is best suited to your lifestyle commitments. We will also provide you with a generous benefits package.

Corporate Digital & Applications (CDA) is a small team with a big impact.

We look after the BBC intranet, internal web and mobile apps and external corporate sites which receive millions of views from our audience every month.
We have a modern technology stack and use a range of AWS technologies such as Lambda, OpenSearch, S3, and Aurora. We mainly build services using JavaScript, with our front-ends typically being React and our primary API being serverless GraphQL.
As the BBC reaffirms its digital ambition, we have an opportunity for a Junior Software Engineer to join our team and work alongside other developers to improve and develop our suite of products. We are looking for someone who has a good basic understanding of web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and with a passion to learn and develop their skills. There will be opportunities to gain experience in both front end and back end development.
We will take a genuine interest in your career and help you develop and grow with training, hands-on experience and regular feedback in a friendly and supportive atmosphere. We also want you to take regular personal development time to develop your skills in your own way.
Main Responsibilities
Learn and apply relevant technologies used by the team to make effective contributions to our code base.
Work closely with the product team
Participate in the development of effective software that meets given specifications.
Participate in the team's software development methodologies, such as pairing, code reviews, agile planning and continuous delivery
Write appropriate unit tests to ensure code-quality
Are you the right candidate?

We are keen to hear from you if you have:
A passion for web development and a willingness to learn and develop
Some experience in modern programming languages and/or frameworks
Excellent communications skills and a collaborative attitude
Troubleshooting and problem-solving skills
Basic knowledge of software code versioning and repositories (such as Git)

Web Developer

Each year, millions enjoy Tate’s digital products and content.

We’re seeking talented developers who will help us continue improving our website, deliver digital experiences in our galleries, grow sales through our e-commerce platform, and reinforce Tate’s standing as a leading digital presence within the cultural sector. Reporting to our Senior Web Developer, you will develop applications and features for the Tate website and other visitor-facing projects, from technical design through to production deployment.

With the support of a multi-disciplinary Product and Development team, you will focus on meeting user needs, ensuring that our digital products are effective, reliable, accessible and pleasing to use. The team takes a collaborative approach to projects, with lively discussion and fresh thinking very much at the heart of how we do things.

The last year has underlined the critical importance of Tate’s website: a constant point of access to the museum’s collection and programme, even when our galleries had to close their doors. We have an ambitious road map ahead for delivering an enhanced user experience, better tools for site editors and more tailored content to our audiences, while acting to reduce the climate impact of Tate’s digital presence.

Are you a developer comfortable supporting high-traffic websites and passionate about delivering great experiences to a diverse global audience? If so, we would love to hear from you.

Prior art knowledge is not a requirement. We welcome applications from those who have taken unconventional career routes into tech. Though based at Tate Britain, the Digital team has embraced remote working and would consider applications from outside the London area.

We’re seeking talented developers who will help us continue improving our website, deliver digital experiences in our galleries, grow sales through our e-commerce platform, and reinforce Tate’s standing as a leading digital presence within the cultural sector. Reporting to our Senior Web Developer, you will develop applications and features for the Tate website and other visitor-facing projects, from technical design through to production deployment.

With the support of a multi-disciplinary Product and Development team, you will focus on meeting user needs, ensuring that our digital products are effective, reliable, accessible and pleasing to use. The team takes a collaborative approach to projects, with lively discussion and fresh thinking very much at the heart of how we do things.

The last year has underlined the critical importance of Tate’s website: a constant point of access to the museum’s collection and programme, even when our galleries had to close their doors. We have an ambitious road map ahead for delivering an enhanced user experience, better tools for site editors and more tailored content to our audiences, while acting to reduce the climate impact of Tate’s digital presence.

Are you a developer comfortable supporting high-traffic websites and passionate about delivering great experiences to a diverse global audience? If so, we would love to hear from you.

Prior art knowledge is not a requirement. We welcome applications from those who have taken unconventional career routes into tech. Though based at Tate Britain, the Digital team has embraced remote working and would consider applications from outside the London area.

Applications are invited for the post of Web & Application Developer in the IT Department.
This post will work across both the Student Administrative Systems Team and the Web & Mobile Apps team helping to design and implement elegant and compelling web-based experiences that enable colleagues and students to interact with the University’s digital services.
The post holder will continue their personal development journey at Royal Holloway by assisting with the design of interactive prototypes, participate in the daily scrums and help turn the prototypes into working solutions using a wide range of front-end and back end technologies such as HTML5, Angular JS, Bootstrap, Sass, MS Graph and other vendor / platform specific APIs and workflow solutions.

Knowledge of Angular JS or a server side language such as ASP.Net or PHP or of the Microsoft Power platform and Graph APIs is desirable but not essential as training can be provided if necessary.
The successful candidate will also possess excellent attention to detail as they will be creating elements for use on the public website and business critical services, they will have clear written and verbal communications skills and will be able to demonstrate a logical approach to problem solving.

In the last few years our prominence has been in the hospitality sector but our client range includes governmental. We understand that the different skills and experiences that our colleagues from different backgrounds bring to us allow us to make better decisions, consider different views and be an altogether more interesting and cohesive place to work.

We are now recruiting for Web Developers to join our existing team.

You will work within our highly skilled development team on a variety of exciting and new projects.

We’re looking for someone who can bring the same enthusiasm and energy into every project and grow their experience and skills through working on projects and collaborating with the development team.

This role is a hybrid remote role where you will be working from home and at our head office in Leeds.

This role is diverse and will mainly require you to work on developing client microsites based on a template driven system and helping when required with new and existing projects. The role will be more front-end focused, but the applicant will need a working understanding of OOP, C#, ASP.NET and MS SQL Server.

Your skill set should include:

Experience of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.
Understanding/experience of OOP, C#, ASP.NET and MS SQL Server.
Understanding/experience working with Rest APIs, .NET Core and Web Forms is a bonus.
Passion for coding, designing and an eagerness to learn.
Image editing skills.

The approach you need to bring to the role:

Excellent problem solving and communication skills.
Exhibit a passion for digital excellence.
Ability to work quickly and flexibly, with the mental agility to make good decisions and embed learning.
A natural collaborator who enjoys working with the internal team.
Willing to embrace all aspects of working in a growing business, from strategic thinking to creating processes and training guides.

What will be expected of you?

At first, you will most likely be:

Assisting with project setup – learning processes and how things fit together.
Making amends to existing projects and microsites based on client and internal feedback.
Participating and supporting creating new microsites.
Learning

Eventually, you will be:

Taking ownership of projects from start to finish.
Working closely with the rest of the team to deliver these projects.
Working on a wider variety of projects with a larger scope.
Still learning.

In time, we think you should be:

Writing high-quality code that is understood by others and runs within any performance requirements.
Being solely responsible for delivering the technical parts of a project.
Fixing bugs and sharing what was learned from these occasions.
Liaising with project management team when technical input is required.
Providing technical guidance to the wider team.
Always learning!

What we offer

As well as the usual suspects, including a pension plan and a competitive salary, we also offer:

28 days holiday, plus bank holidays and extra time off for Christmas (including Christmas Eve)
A relaxed working atmosphere at our office in Leeds with great transportation links and free parking.

This is a great opportunity for an enthusiastic and ambitious person to join a team where your ideas and opinion will be valued!

The Grad Scheme,NA,Graduate Web Developer,"Darlington, North East England, England","About the Role
In this role, you’ll join our ever-growing development team at The Verve Group and have the opportunity to be hands-on with the industry-changing technology that we build, learn the processes of working in an agile team and help us make change through FinTech.
For this role, join our growing development team as a junior web developer and immediately get the chance to see our processes and play a part in building the web-based technology that our clients use every single day. We’ll support you every step of the way (supporting students is our bread and butter after all) with mentoring from other team members and your own tailored training and progression plan.
We put a huge importance on ‘making a difference’ and each of us likes to make that difference, in a different way. In your role, you’ll work closely with each member of the team to see our work and process in action and our ideas come to life – it’s here’s where you’ll find areas that interest you the most and begin to shape your own career. It could be testing, API development or working as a full-stack developer – so, why don’t we find out?
As your role develops, you have the opportunity to take a more active role in developing our applications and take the lead for features and planning how to best deliver them, working with external teams and partners to keep us at the very front of FinTech.
The Skills
Along with a tech related degree, you'll need an understanding of a programming language like php and javascript, a passion for building technology that makes a difference and the ability to work as part of a fast-moving team.
About Us
The Verve Group is combined of a number of companies, including Para-Sols (an outsourced paraplanning company), Apricity Compliance (providing compliance support to advisers), The Art of Finance (which provides training courses for those looking to develop a career in financial services) and finally, The Verve Foundation (a not-for-profit that invests in the future of finance). The Group of companies all work towards the same two missions; to help support good quality financial advice firms to grow and develop, and to attract new people into financial services and help train them up, for the good of the future of finance.
Across all companies, we approach financial services with a fun and positive outlook and offer a range of benefits to permanent employees to ensure our staff feel supported and motivated. We reward loyalty and offer enhanced benefits to long-service employees, but as standard (once you’ve successfully completed your 6 month probation) these include…
Standard benefits
26 days holiday (including days off at Christmas) PLUS bank holidays AND your birthday off (if it falls on a weekday)
Personalised salary structure to reflect your own effort and contribution
Death in Service cover
Personal Development budget (for exams, training, anything to help you excel!)
Company Pension Scheme
Optional working from home policy, 2 days per week (on completion of probation)
What makes us different benefits
Health and Wellbeing programme, including hoodie, drinks bottle and fitness tracker
Office snacks and refreshments
Open plan ‘living office’ environment – including rocking (or sometimes dubious) playlists, beer/wine fridge, breakout lounge and breakfast club
2 official annual company parties, plus ad hoc team nights out.
Office dogs – we’re not a place for people scared of dogs!
Did we mention there’s no lock on the beer/wine fridge?!
