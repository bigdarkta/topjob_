Thesis,4.4,Web Developer - Web / Email,"Portland, OR","Who are we?
Thesis, a digital agency in Portland, OR. We’re hell-bent on humanizing the relationship between people and brands, which starts with our teams: real people making real work. Come as you are. Bring what you bring. We’ve been around for 20 years. In contrast to our former identity that reflected what we do, we chose the name Thesis as it better represents how we do it: a full-service agency believing our strength is in our approach—believing how the work we make is only as strong as the thought—and data—we put behind it. That sounds intense. But make no mistake, we also play real hard.

Two Barrels,4.3,Junior Front-End Web Developer,"Spokane, WA","Overview: Two Barrels is hiring a Junior Front-End Web Developer for $75,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full time 40 hour M-F position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.As a Junior Front-End Web Developer at Two Barrels, you’ll play a pivotal role in updating, maintaining and creating a wide variety of websites. On a daily basis, you’ll be working and learning from other front-end devs to develop your skills and help make our websites awesome!Our team of writers and designers craft the content for our websites and our front-end team makes the magic happen.What’s in a title?Here at Two Barrels we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.Location: Spokane, WADuration: Full TimeWage: $75,000/yearResponsibilities: Launch, maintain, and update a variety of websitesOptimize sites for scale and feasibilityWork with a team of front end developers to create awesome websitesAccurately replicating mock ups into fully fledged websitesCollaborate with content writers and designersMinimum Qualifications: 1+ year of experience working with HTML and CSS1+ year of experience converting design files into HTML and CSS1+ year of experience working with JavaScript and jQueryKnowledge of responsive design, some experience implementing within a project or websiteWorking knowledge of CSS Frameworks, preferably BootstrapWorking knowledge of CSS Preprocessors (SASS, LESS)Experience using version control tools like gitExposure to WordpressAny position that is required to work in office regularly or on occasion must have received or be willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine by date of hire to be considered for the job unless state law prohibits employers from requiring vaccines.Preferred Qualifications: Experience with server side web development languages like PHPWhy you might like this job: As a Junior Front-End Dev, we know you’re talented but still have a lot to learn.

"Bizzuka, Inc.",2.3,Web Front-End Developer,"Lafayette, LA","Can you handle both?
We are looking for a few talented individuals who can design not only beautiful websites, but can also build out those designs on WordPress quickly and efficiently.
Your mission (should you decide to accept it) will be to design the UI/UX, as well as the actual code that will produce all visual elements of our clients' websites or web applications. Your expertise will help you bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the site or application looks as well as how it works.
Responsibilities?
You'll have several. You'll be responsible for designing beautiful but usable designs and interfaces for clients. You'll oversee the recommendation and implementation of WordPress plugins as well as the development of custom user-facing features. You'll create reusable code and assemble libraries for future use. You'll work with our QA team to ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs, and you'll also work with our tech team to optimize any custom applications for maximum speed and scalability.
To pull this off, you'll need to have a good understanding of Conversion-centric design. We're not about creating designs that entertain the designer. We're about creating designs that convert visitors into customers. So, your expertise in building funnels and website conversion opportunities will be critical to the success of our clients.
You need to be a team player who is passionate about learning, teaching, serving, and growing. This industry changes fast, so if you like change, strap on and hold tight, because we push change to its maximum every day.
Skills And Qualifications
You definitely need to know your way around Photoshop and Illustrator, plus you'll need to know how to build a WordPress site with as little custom CSS as possible. The goal is to leverage the power that is built into WordPress and not build every page independently of the CMS. When it comes time to make a site or application really sing, though, you'll need to demonstrate your proficient understanding of web markup, including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and JavaScript.
Ideally, you'd have a great understanding of designing using Thrive Architect, Divi, or WP Bakery. You'll also need a good understanding of SEO principles and ensure that our clients' websites will adhere to them.
Oh, and you'll not only need to be creative, but you're going to need to be fast. We have the need for speed at Bizzuka, because our clients depend on us to help them increase revenues and decrease expenses by automating lead generation or automating manual processes. The sooner we fix their problems, the more of an impact we can have on their business and the customers they serve.
Our clients expect and deserve the best. If that sounds like something you can get behind, then attach your resume with a link to your portfolio of work. Can you handle both?

The goal is to leverage the power that is built into WordPress and not build every page independently of the CMS. When it comes time to make a site or application really sing, though, you'll need to demonstrate your proficient understanding of web markup, including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and JavaScript.
Ideally, you'd have a great understanding of designing using Thrive Architect, Divi, or WP Bakery. You'll also need a good understanding of SEO principles and ensure that our clients' websites will adhere to them.
Oh, and you'll not only need to be creative, but you're going to need to be fast. We have the need for speed at Bizzuka, because our clients depend on us to help them increase revenues and decrease expenses by automating lead generation or automating manual processes. The sooner we fix their problems, the more of an impact we can have on their business and the customers they serve.
Our clients expect and deserve the best. If that sounds like something you can get behind, then attach your resume with a link to your portfolio of work. Can you handle both?
We are looking for a few talented individuals who can design not only beautiful websites, but can also build out those designs on WordPress quickly and efficiently.
Your mission (should you decide to accept it) will be to design the UI/UX, as well as the actual code that will produce all visual elements of our clients' websites or web applications. Your expertise will help you bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the site or application looks as well as how it works.
Responsibilities?
You'll have several. You'll be responsible for designing beautiful but usable designs and interfaces for clients. You'll oversee the recommendation and implementation of WordPress plugins as well as the development of custom user-facing features. You'll create reusable code and assemble libraries for future use. You'll work with our QA team to ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs, and you'll also work with our tech team to optimize any custom applications for maximum speed and scalability.
To pull this off, you'll need to have a good understanding of Conversion-centric design. We're not about creating designs that entertain the designer. We're about creating designs that convert visitors into customers. So, your expertise in building funnels and website conversion opportunities will be critical to the success of our clients.
You need to be a team player who is passionate about learning, teaching, serving, and growing. This industry changes fast, so if you like change, strap on and hold tight, because we push change to its maximum every day.

Biofire Technologies,4.5,Full-Stack Web Developer,"Broomfield, CO","WHO WE ARE

Biofire Technologies is on a mission to give gun owners better tools for reducing preventable gun injuries and deaths, especially among children. We believe our technology, combined with a best-in-class customer experience, will define the future of firearms safety for the next generation. Our mission-driven approach has earned support from the firearm community, the tech world, and the media.

Biofire employees are world-class engineers who have designed and tested firearms, medical devices, robots, cars, satellites, rockets, and supersonic jets. What unites our team is our commitment to safety and reliability that we bring to our work every day.


OUR CULTURE

Reducing accidental firearm injuries and deaths requires original thinking and authentic collaboration, so we’re deeply invested in building a team and culture that can achieve our mission together. Team members enjoy autonomy and flexibility from day one, so expect to be immediately tasked with solving challenging problems and building new systems that work. We’ll hold you accountable for executing on audacious goals, giving and receiving honest feedback, and helping your teammates succeed. You’ll receive respect, kindness, and support from every direction while you figure out how to get it all done.


ABOUT THE ROLE

As a Full Stack Web Developer at Biofire you will be responsible for building and maintaining Biofire’s web properties, including our primary website Biofire.io. You will be responsible for Biofire’s digital “front window”, owning the development, performance, and effectiveness of our web-based customer engagement. You will work iteratively across teams to build custom features and bring new ideas to life, all in service of deepening Biofire’s ability to engage with our customers through our web platforms.

To succeed you will need to be an expert in modern front- and back-end web architecture and development, and adept at working with non-technical users to implement feature ideas in a performant, easy-to-maintain way. You will need to be a curious problem-solver, rapidly learning Biofire’s business objectives and challenges and contributing your technical acumen to address them via our web platform. You will work quickly on multiple priorities at once, and will draw on your excellent communication and prioritization skills. As the development team grows, your teammates will rely on your clean, well-documented code to continue extending the platform.

If you are excited about advancing Biofire’s mission by creating web platforms that deeply engage our customers, we encourage you to apply.


KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

Day to day responsibilities of the role will include:

Owning the development, performance, and iteration of Biofire’s web properties, especially our primary website, Biofire.io;
Developing deeply engaging custom features, beyond the limits of traditional CMS platforms, including dynamic content pages, customer-specific engagement paths, and A/B testing infrastructure to support continuous iteration;
Owning, managing, and continuously improving website environments (Dev, Staging, and Prod), Biofire’s full-stack website toolset, and all third party integrations;
Ensuring comprehensive website security, proactively maintaining patches and upgrades to mitigate vulnerabilities;
Continuously improving site performance, ensuring uptime and minimizing performance impact on SEO;
Working with teams across Biofire to build new web functionality that engages our customers in new and better ways.


COMPENSATION, BENEFITS & PERKS

We’ll need you to bring your very best, so we give you what you need to do a great job. You’ll enjoy flexible hours, teammates you will like, respect, and be inspired by, and all the technical resources you might need at our Broomfield office.

In addition to our competitive pay and stock options, Biofire offers fully covered medical, dental, and vision benefits, a funded Health Spending Account, unlimited PTO (that team members actually use - we promise), a 401(k) with employer matching, and a 14 week parental leave policy. We deliver perks including noise-canceling headphones, the premium music streaming service of your choice, and anything else you’d need to succeed in your role (within reason).

This is a full-time, salaried role with a flexible work-from-home policy. The compensation range for this role is $100K - $150K.


QUALIFICATIONS

If you think you will succeed in this role, and love the work you’ll do, we encourage you to apply regardless of your background. We evaluate candidates based on their unique talents and fit for our needs, not a rigid list of qualifications.


LOCATION AND HOURS

Our dog-friendly, state-of-the-art headquarters is located in beautiful Broomfield, Colorado, between Boulder and Denver. Most roles require team members to frequently collaborate in person, but you will enjoy the flexibility to work from home when you need to. We trust you to communicate with your team to make things work.


DIVERSITY & INCLUSION

We’re bringing innovation to a technological problem that has persisted for decades, so we depend on diverse, inclusive, and collaborative teams to break new ground and do great work. We welcome people from all qualified backgrounds, and we don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, political affiliation, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.


ELIGIBILITY

This role handles information subject to US Export Control Regulations. Applicants must be (a) a citizen of the United States; (b) a lawful permanent resident of the United States (“Green Card” holder); or (c) a person admitted into the United States as an asylee or refugee to be considered for the position.

We’ll need you to bring your very best, so we give you what you need to do a great job. You’ll enjoy flexible hours, teammates you will like, respect, and be inspired by, and all the technical resources you might need at our Broomfield office.

In addition to our competitive pay and stock options, Biofire offers fully covered medical, dental, and vision benefits, a funded Health Spending Account, unlimited PTO (that team members actually use - we promise), a 401(k) with employer matching, and a 14 week parental leave policy. We deliver perks including noise-canceling headphones, the premium music streaming service of your choice, and anything else you’d need to succeed in your role (within reason).

This is a full-time, salaried role with a flexible work-from-home policy. The compensation range for this role is $100K - $150K.


QUALIFICATIONS

If you think you will succeed in this role, and love the work you’ll do, we encourage you to apply regardless of your background. We evaluate candidates based on their unique talents and fit for our needs, not a rigid list of qualifications.


LOCATION AND HOURS

Our dog-friendly, state-of-the-art headquarters is located in beautiful Broomfield, Colorado, between Boulder and Denver. Most roles require team members to frequently collaborate in person, but you will enjoy the flexibility to work from home when you need to. We trust you to communicate with your team to make things work.


DIVERSITY & INCLUSION

We’re bringing innovation to a technological problem that has persisted for decades, so we depend on diverse, inclusive, and collaborative teams to break new ground and do great work. We welcome people from all qualified backgrounds, and we don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, political affiliation, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.


ELIGIBILITY

This role handles information subject to US Export Control Regulations. Applicants must be (a) a citizen of the United States; (b) a lawful permanent resident of the United States (“Green Card” holder); or (c) a person admitted into the United States as an asylee or refugee to be considered for the position. WHO WE ARE

Biofire Technologies is on a mission to give gun owners better tools for reducing preventable gun injuries and deaths, especially among children. We believe our technology, combined with a best-in-class customer experience, will define the future of firearms safety for the next generation. Our mission-driven approach has earned support from the firearm community, the tech world, and the media.

Biofire employees are world-class engineers who have designed and tested firearms, medical devices, robots, cars, satellites, rockets, and supersonic jets. What unites our team is our commitment to safety and reliability that we bring to our work every day.


OUR CULTURE

Reducing accidental firearm injuries and deaths requires original thinking and authentic collaboration, so we’re deeply invested in building a team and culture that can achieve our mission together. Team members enjoy autonomy and flexibility from day one, so expect to be immediately tasked with solving challenging problems and building new systems that work. We’ll hold you accountable for executing on audacious goals, giving and receiving honest feedback, and helping your teammates succeed. You’ll receive respect, kindness, and support from every direction while you figure out how to get it all done.


ABOUT THE ROLE

As a Full Stack Web Developer at Biofire you will be responsible for building and maintaining Biofire’s web properties, including our primary website Biofire.io. You will be responsible for Biofire’s digital “front window”, owning the development, performance, and effectiveness of our web-based customer engagement. You will work iteratively across teams to build custom features and bring new ideas to life, all in service of deepening Biofire’s ability to engage with our customers through our web platforms.

To succeed you will need to be an expert in modern front- and back-end web architecture and development, and adept at working with non-technical users to implement feature ideas in a performant, easy-to-maintain way. You will need to be a curious problem-solver, rapidly learning Biofire’s business objectives and challenges and contributing your technical acumen to address them via our web platform. You will work quickly on multiple priorities at once, and will draw on your excellent communication and prioritization skills. As the development team grows, your teammates will rely on your clean, well-documented code to continue extending the platform.

If you are excited about advancing Biofire’s mission by creating web platforms that deeply engage our customers, we encourage you to apply.


KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

Day to day responsibilities of the role will include:

Owning the development, performance, and iteration of Biofire’s web properties, especially our primary website, Biofire.io;
Developing deeply engaging custom features, beyond the limits of traditional CMS platforms, including dynamic content pages, customer-specific engagement paths, and A/B testing infrastructure to support continuous iteration;
Owning, managing, and continuously improving website environments (Dev, Staging, and Prod), Biofire’s full-stack website toolset, and all third party integrations;
Ensuring comprehensive website security, proactively maintaining patches and upgrades to mitigate vulnerabilities;
Continuously improving site performance, ensuring uptime and minimizing performance impact on SEO;
Working with teams across Biofire to build new web functionality that engages our customers in new and better ways.
