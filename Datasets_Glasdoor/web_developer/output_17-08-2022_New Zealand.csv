As an engineer for this forward-thinking startup, you will not be locked in the backroom implementing specs sheets - you’ll be talking to the customers/teachers who already love their product, and figuring out how to make it work even better for them. This position will suit an Engineer with a good product sense and is comfortable working relatively autonomously but who can also collaborate well both internally and externally.

With the majority of users based in the US, we travel to attend conferences, trade shows and to visit schools using our software. So ideally you will relish the opportunity to travel and have no passport restrictions.
Qualifications

Technical skills and experience required for the role are:

Proficiency with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and experience working with large Single Page Applications (SPAs). Experience with frontend frameworks/libraries, e.g AngularJS, VueJS, React.
Strong product sense and ability to work with customers to design bespoke solutions.
Experience with developing high-performance front-end code, profiling with Chrome Developer tools.
Appetite to learn new languages and technologies.
They adopt the latest tech fast, including Service Workers, Native Client, and real-time communication in our app (Most of their users are on evergreen browsers, so we get to use the new web technologies).
This is primarily a front-end engineering position, however, they use Ruby, Rails, Java, Kubernetes (with GKE).
PostgreSQL and CockroachDB in the backend and experience with them is a bonus.
Great communication and engagement skills.
A positive, passionate and collaborative approach.

Technologies we use: (Nice to Have)

Sandfield,4.2,Software Developer,Auckland,"Do you want to work on projects where you’re actually trusted and empowered to make meaningful change for some of Australasia’s leading companies?Dream of working in a place you can call home rather than have to change your career every two years to get ahead?Want to be part of a team that focuses on getting the job done and having a good time while doing it?If you answered yes to any of the above...then we should talk!We’re Sandfield and we build smart software solutions for some of Australasia’s top brands.We’re working on some pretty cool projects right now and there’s plenty more in our (very long) pipeline...so we need more talented Software Developers to join our awesome team.*About Sandfield*We’re a leading, Kiwi-owned, software business that prides itself on NOT just being a conventional tech company.We've been backing ourselves, and our ability to create great solutions for clients, since we first opened our doors in 1989. Since then, we’ve developed some pretty innovative systems for clients which leave other, more high-profile, software packages in the dust.Our work facilitates high performance supply chains for the likes of Mainfreight, Qube and Allied Concrete and keeps millions of orders and data points flowing for Foodstuffs. It also manages business finances for Toll and Green Acres, helps fill seats on the Interislander for KiwiRail and keeps Les Mills members engaged...plus so much more.One thing we think speaks for itself is that we’ve never had a sales team - our work and success story has been predominantly built on our reputation and referrals alone.*Our pitch to you*We know it’s a competitive market out there and loads of other companies are also probably trying to ‘woo’ you right now with big numbers and equally big promises.What we can offer is something a little more special.Our developers get to deal directly with our clients and we spend just as much time nurturing soft skills, such as communication and business acumen, as we do helping our developers be even more ‘ninja’ at their coding.We guarantee your ‘everyday’ will be interesting, varied, challenging and fun! You’ll get to work with a range of other smart developers of all levels, who also happen to be really great people too.They’re mountain bikers, road bikers, skiers, runners, active relaxers, video gamers, animal lovers, movie buffs, gym buffs, foodies, wine critics, bakers and musicians.

Since then, we’ve developed some pretty innovative systems for clients which leave other, more high-profile, software packages in the dust.Our work facilitates high performance supply chains for the likes of Mainfreight, Qube and Allied Concrete and keeps millions of orders and data points flowing for Foodstuffs. It also manages business finances for Toll and Green Acres, helps fill seats on the Interislander for KiwiRail and keeps Les Mills members engaged...plus so much more.One thing we think speaks for itself is that we’ve never had a sales team - our work and success story has been predominantly built on our reputation and referrals alone.*Our pitch to you*We know it’s a competitive market out there and loads of other companies are also probably trying to ‘woo’ you right now with big numbers and equally big promises.What we can offer is something a little more special.Our developers get to deal directly with our clients and we spend just as much time nurturing soft skills, such as communication and business acumen, as we do helping our developers be even more ‘ninja’ at their coding.We guarantee your ‘everyday’ will be interesting, varied, challenging and fun! You’ll get to work with a range of other smart developers of all levels, who also happen to be really great people too.They’re mountain bikers, road bikers, skiers, runners, active relaxers, video gamers, animal lovers, movie buffs, gym buffs, foodies, wine critics, bakers and musicians. They’re also family people, single people, party people, quiet people, loud people and happy people.Our collaborative culture is at the centre of everything we do at Sandfield and it makes it a pretty special place to work.

Unleashed Software,3.7,Software Developer (Intermediate to Senior),Auckland,"Unleashed Software (that’s us) are a cloud-based solution at the heart of great businesses that make, manage and move products - and we've had a busy couple of years. We hit double digits, celebrating 10 years in business, were fortunate enough to pick up some fabulous accolades (winning the Westpac Business Awards 'Employer of the Year','Supreme Business Excellence' in 2019 and be the recipient of the Xero Small Business App of the Year), set up a new team and office in Melbourne, and we became one of the newest members of the Access Group (in APAC) in November 2020. Plus lots of really really important BAU work got done - all whilst navigating that very annoying C-word (yep - Covid).
Our global team (made up of Engineering, Product, Customer Engagement, Sales, Marketing & Operations) has grown to over 120 employees (and a dog or two) and we’re now looking for highly skilled individuals who are excellent collaborators with fantastic implementation skills. We’re always evolving and updating our technology and the passion to pick-up new technologies is paramount.
To give you a bit of background.... in our earlier days, our SaaS product was a feature-rich, customer-focused ASP.NET web application built iteratively over a number of years. The original version of our product was built on a private cloud host, and we only deployed updates a few times per-year (manually, by the way!). In the last few years, we have been hard at work, embracing automation & agile practices, and transforming our architecture into a modern component-based web app & service stack using the latest AWS cloud technologies, whilst always keeping our customers at the forefront of our mind - continually growing, enhancing and improving the product. We now test and deploy automatically, and release updates to our customers at least twice a week. As we continue our evolution, we want to release product updates multiple times per day and become 100% AWS native (which includes moving to a scalable microservices architecture).
To give you a glimpse of how we are doing things currently, our latest projects use .NET Core, React, and Angular - with Microservice and Serverless application architectures. We are currently a significant user of AWS technologies and we expect that to continue growing.APIs are obviously really important to us for our core systems’ architecture as well as our direct integrations with other high profile SaaS Companies (Xero, Shopify, Amazon, Vend, etc). We collaborate using Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, but we prefer to let each of our teams decide what suits them best. We always encourage open communication across all functional areas and reporting lines.
You will be part of a small, cross-functional and self-organising team focused on quality, working on a suite of web applications, and implementing cutting-edge web technologies. You will be expected to interpret requirements, design, develop, validate and release your work within our adaptive agile culture - incorporating scrum, Kanban, TDD and XP – using the right methodology to achieve and maintain the result required. You are encouraged to grow technical skills & product knowledge and we ask that you learn and take manageable risks, expect and interpret feedback on your performance and have an open mind for personal training and development opportunities as they arise.
We know this isn't your conventional detailed job advert, but really we wanted to just paint a picture of who we are, where we're going and to see if you're interested in joining us on this awesome journey. Recruitment in the current climate is certainly a bit different, however, we're working hard to make sure we can give you a great understanding of what life at Unleashed is like and to induct and onboard you to be successful.


Here at Unleashed we also believe there is great value in having a workforce that represents the customers we interact with on a daily basis, which is why we embrace an approach that respects, values and celebrates the unique attributes, characteristics, and perspectives that make each person who they are and ask people to bring their true authentic selves to work each day.

Common sense and the ability to ""read between the lines"".

Understanding of websites/web applications and finding edge cases to break sites.
Able to accurately test websites in multiple browsers/OS.
Creating and running test cases on a daily basis.

And if you have any of the following, be sure to mention them when applying!

Career Development: You’ll be encouraged to level up your skillset at every opportunity. We’ll cover the cost of any training and courses you need to create first-class products for our customers.
Ego-Free Work Culture: No dress code. No unreasonable deadlines. No micromanagement. We’re a diverse team from all over the globe. We hire the best people for the job and help each other improve through constructive feedback and support.

LMAX Group,4.2,Software Developer,Auckland,"Description:
LMAX Group is looking for a new developer to join their Auckland based team.

Our values:

Commitment to quality. LMAX Group was an early adopter and continues to be a leader
in the area of Continuous Delivery. We believe a system based on “fast feedback cycles”
is a great way to build a stable, well performing system. To support this we employ a

lot of automated testing, automated deployment and continuous integration.
The automated test suite gives our developers confidence to make significant changes
to the system.
Working collaboratively. Software is not built in a vacuum, people with blended skill sets
working together produces the best results. We use practices like collaborative design and
pair programming. This allows us to work together on design and implementation as well as

sharing knowledge and helping new starters get up to speed quickly. For testing we eschew a

“throw it over the wall” mentality and developers will write and do a lot of their own testing,

which frees up the test analysts to do higher value exploratory testing.

Keeping it simple. Modern software systems are very complex. Simplicity helps us build a more
reliable and higher performing system. We work hard to ensure our systems are as simple as

possible to solve the problems at hand. Unfortunately, simple isn’t easy and we will often put
in that extra bit of effort to get us to a satisfactory solution.

Always improving. We think we do a number of things well (many of our team have spoken at

conferences about how we build software and handle challenging performance problems), but we

recognise that we are far from perfect and can always get better. We regularly examine our

successes and failures to look at how we can improve. We have a generous training budget

for our technology staff.

Requirements:
What you’ll work on:

Design. You will be working with other members of the team to determine how to implement
a given feature or meet a specific requirement. This is a fairly fluid process with lots of
discussion and white-boarding, while avoiding extensive documentation.
Coding, and lots of it. The majority of our code base is in Java, which continues to be our
language of choice - we stay up to date and use the latest versions and language features.
There is a decent chunk of Web technology (Javascript, HTML, and CSS) and SQL too.
Production support. A necessary part of any production system. All developers participate
in supporting our business and technology operations staff to resolve issues as they occur.
Performance testing and profiling. Working on a financial exchange brings some interesting
throughput and latency challenges, so we care a lot more about software performance than
many other organisations. This often requires investigative work and digging deep into the
internals of our systems to understand how they behave.

What we’re looking for:

Above all we are looking for someone who shares our values and is great to work with.
Compensation will be based on the level of experience and expertise that you
bring to the team.
Knowledge of our technology stack and business domain is useful, but by no means a
requirement. However, you will need to be happy working with our set of technologies and
be willing to retrain if required.

Additional Notes:

LMAX Group is an equal opportunity employer and actively seeks to ensure that we continue to attract applications from a diverse range of candidates to reflect the diversity that already exists across the organisation
Optionally a small amount of international travel is available
We manage our workflow to free up Friday afternoons to work on self-chosen projects outside of the immediate business priorities
 You must have appropriate eligibility to work in New Zealand.

successes and failures to look at how we can improve. We have a generous training budget

for our technology staff.

Requirements:
What you’ll work on:

Design. You will be working with other members of the team to determine how to implement
a given feature or meet a specific requirement. This is a fairly fluid process with lots of
discussion and white-boarding, while avoiding extensive documentation.
Coding, and lots of it. The majority of our code base is in Java, which continues to be our
language of choice - we stay up to date and use the latest versions and language features.
There is a decent chunk of Web technology (Javascript, HTML, and CSS) and SQL too.
Production support. A necessary part of any production system. All developers participate
in supporting our business and technology operations staff to resolve issues as they occur.
Performance testing and profiling. Working on a financial exchange brings some interesting
throughput and latency challenges, so we care a lot more about software performance than
many other organisations. This often requires investigative work and digging deep into the
internals of our systems to understand how they behave.

What we’re looking for:

Above all we are looking for someone who shares our values and is great to work with.
Compensation will be based on the level of experience and expertise that you
bring to the team.
Knowledge of our technology stack and business domain is useful, but by no means a
requirement. However, you will need to be happy working with our set of technologies and
be willing to retrain if required.

Additional Notes:

LMAX Group is an equal opportunity employer and actively seeks to ensure that we continue to attract applications from a diverse range of candidates to reflect the diversity that already exists across the organisation
Optionally a small amount of international travel is available

FULL-TIME Description:
LMAX Group is looking for a new developer to join their Auckland based team.

Our values:

Commitment to quality. LMAX Group was an early adopter and continues to be a leader
in the area of Continuous Delivery. We believe a system based on “fast feedback cycles”
is a great way to build a stable, well performing system. To support this we employ a

lot of automated testing, automated deployment and continuous integration.
The automated test suite gives our developers confidence to make significant changes
to the system.
Working collaboratively. Software is not built in a vacuum, people with blended skill sets
working together produces the best results. We use practices like collaborative design and
pair programming. This allows us to work together on design and implementation as well as

sharing knowledge and helping new starters get up to speed quickly. For testing we eschew a

“throw it over the wall” mentality and developers will write and do a lot of their own testing,

which frees up the test analysts to do higher value exploratory testing.

Keeping it simple. Modern software systems are very complex. Simplicity helps us build a more
reliable and higher performing system. We work hard to ensure our systems are as simple as

possible to solve the problems at hand. Unfortunately, simple isn’t easy and we will often put
in that extra bit of effort to get us to a satisfactory solution.

Always improving. We think we do a number of things well (many of our team have spoken at

conferences about how we build software and handle challenging performance problems), but we

recognise that we are far from perfect and can always get better. We regularly examine our

successes and failures to look at how we can improve. We have a generous training budget

for our technology staff.

Contributing as part of the wider team to achieve organisational objectives even if this means doing things that aren't strictly within the scope of your role!

We believe that Product Design is a unique and niche discipline. We believe that we're on the forefront of that discipline and are inventing the ways design and developer teams will be working in the future. So we're focusing on hiring Product Designers that we can mentor and help develop into modern Product Designers who are operating at the cutting-edge and inventing the future of our industry.

What you need to bring:

Experience designing products, or working with teams who build with web technologies;
Experience with or knowledge of a visual design tool like Figma, Bohemian Sketch or Adobe Illustrator;

What's in it for you?
Ability to do your job in a truly flexible environment;

Do you want to work for a company that is innovating and making a difference to the health and wellbeing of people all over the world? We're not about selling meaningless, unnecessary products for corporate profitability. You'll be working on technology that will revolutionise global health systems so that we can finally get the healthcare we all want - a basic human right.

We like to think of ourselves as a community of start ups where you can be your true, genuine self. Each of our product teams have the autonomy to decide how they operate and contribute towards our mission of providing each person with the right care at the right time and in the right place.

Orion Health is excited to be expanding our galaxy by recruiting for a number of stellar individuals to join our team to help us deliver to our global customer base. If you want to climb aboard the rocketship and help us revolutionise global health systems, astronomical opportunities await.


What will you be doing?

We are on the hunt for an experienced Front End Developer to join our Auckland Digital Front Door team.

Orion Health's digital front door is a secure, open, and scalable platform that enables organisations to bring new and existing patient engagement technologies together into a unified, user-friendly hub.

As a Senior Front-End Developer in our Digital Front Door team, you'll be building functional, intuitive and beautiful web-based applications, working primarily on exciting new digital healthcare products. In addition, software integration with third party providers and existing Orion Health products will be a focus.


What will you bring to the role?

Experience: You are a web developer with commercial and single-page application experience, with a solid understanding of software architecture and design. You will have used agile working practices to analyse, design, troubleshoot, and modify complex software products. You will be no stranger to technical leadership and will be confident in mentoring and growing junior developers.
Must have skills: You must be familiar with technologies and tools including:
React Redux (or similar)
JavaScript or TypeScript
HTML, CSS
Modern web software architecture frameworks, using RESTful APIs
Troubleshooting skills
Nice to have skills:
Familiarity with AWS services (EC2, ECS, Pinpoint, Kendra etc.)
Containerisation (Docker)
Agile development
Content management systems (Strapi)
Java
Characteristics: You like to get stuck in, and have a positive, open-minded and energetic attitude. You have an eye for detail, enjoy understanding how things work under the hood, excellent communication skills, and thrive in a collaborative, professional work environment.


What's in it for you?

Health Insurance (eligibility applies).
Ability to top up your standard annual leave balance with LeavePlus.
Work for up to 30 days per year in another country through our TravelFlex initiative.
You'll use the latest languages and platforms and will be joining the ranks of the most talented and experienced tech workers in the industry.
Our relaxed, open plan offices have a vibrant and energetic atmosphere. We also have a casual dress-code so you will feel as comfortable in the office as you would at home.
Flexibility is important. We encourage our people to design a workday that suits them by offering flexible working arrangements.
Love food and coffee? We provide free breakfast and fruit every day and have a barista coffee machine in the office - not to mention the onsite cafe discount!
With weekly Friday drinks and an active social club, Orionites are never short of good times and we pride ourselves on our fun community.
We support our Orionites keenness to learn and grow by providing unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning. Innovate with purpose

Qamcom NZ develops innovative products that combine computing, data, and communications.
We're looking for a full stack web technology expert whose broad background and experience equates to creative design solutions that are both elegant and robust. This is where you come in. Interested?
A bit about us
We're a small, friendly company of designers, developers, and engineers.
We're passionate about technology. Our ambition is to turn technology into value for society, industry, and people.
A bit about you
First and foremost; you are an expert full stack developer: from architecture development through to production delivery.
We work with a diverse variety of technologies and platforms. You will be an expert in at least one area, but will relish the challenge to go outside your comfort zone, if required.
Some technologies you will be familiar with include: JavaScript, modern front-end frameworks (e.g. Angular, Vue, React, Bootstrap), NodeJS, SQL, MongoDB, Python, containerisation, and the usual CI/CD pipelines.
You have a solid amount of industry experience, whether you've come from a formal qualification or made your own path.
And you are probably interested in more than just vanilla web software. Maybe you've written high performance apps in Rust; compiled to WebAssembly. And if you have experience analysing and working with large datasets that would be super-interesting to us.
We work in partnership with companies to develop products and so you will know about communication with clients and stakeholders both here in NZ and overseas.
Finally, you have the right to live and work in Wellington, New Zealand. Ideally you're already here!
Some benefits (in addition to a competitive salary)
Our office is in the Wellington CBD with nice views over the city to the harbour.
Do you like skiing? We like doing that too.
We're super-flexible on hours and ways of working. We've been working like this for a long time: well before COVID came along.
And we enjoy working with, and using, the latest tools and technologies.
Still interested?

We work with a diverse variety of technologies and platforms. You will be an expert in at least one area, but will relish the challenge to go outside your comfort zone, if required.
Some technologies you will be familiar with include: JavaScript, modern front-end frameworks (e.g. Angular, Vue, React, Bootstrap), NodeJS, SQL, MongoDB, Python, containerisation, and the usual CI/CD pipelines.
You have a solid amount of industry experience, whether you've come from a formal qualification or made your own path.
And you are probably interested in more than just vanilla web software. Maybe you've written high performance apps in Rust; compiled to WebAssembly. And if you have experience analysing and working with large datasets that would be super-interesting to us.
We work in partnership with companies to develop products and so you will know about communication with clients and stakeholders both here in NZ and overseas.
Finally, you have the right to live and work in Wellington, New Zealand. Ideally you're already here!
Some benefits (in addition to a competitive salary)
Our office is in the Wellington CBD with nice views over the city to the harbour.
Do you like skiing? We like doing that too.
We're super-flexible on hours and ways of working. We've been working like this for a long time: well before COVID came along.
And we enjoy working with, and using, the latest tools and technologies.
Still interested?
Excellent! We have lots to talk about... The opportunity
Qamcom NZ develops innovative products that combine computing, data, and communications.
We're looking for a full stack web technology expert whose broad background and experience equates to creative design solutions that are both elegant and robust. This is where you come in. Interested?
A bit about us
We're a small, friendly company of designers, developers, and engineers.
We're passionate about technology. Our ambition is to turn technology into value for society, industry, and people.
