Procreate,NA,Frontend Developer,Hobart,"The hidden gem of Tasmania
Nestled in picturesque Hobart, Procreate is an industry-leading creative product company competing on the World stage. We are the recipient of two coveted Apple Design Awards and hold the title as best-selling paid iPad app on Apple's App Store for the past five years. Procreate brings together a rare breed of people who are exceptionally driven and dedicated to help people unleash their full creative potential.
We stand by producing the highest quality software and protecting creativity. We care about our work, our community, and most of all, each other. We’re looking for someone who shares these values and is excited to empower people with innovative, accessible, and intuitive software.
Your impact as Frontend Developer
We are constantly refining user experiences, and the way people interact with us as a product and as a brand. We aim to offer seamless and cohesive experiences at every level. To do so, we’re reimagining our web presence by building a new version of Folio, our art sharing platform, and marketplace. You will join the existing team to help deliver these projects.
As a Frontend Developer, you’ll be tasked with developing delightful, intuitive, and user-friendly interfaces which build upon our established design language. In collaboration with our designers, you’ll turn ideas and concepts into reality.
You’ll work in the Marcom department but will also collaborate closely with our Product Development team. The Head of Web and our designers will be your teammates on a daily basis. In addition, you will regularly collaborate with our backend engineers to ensure that you're working together in the most efficient way possible.
Areas of focus
Work on highly visible user facing platforms. You will play a crucial role in the re-imagination and rebuild of Folio and marketplace. It is the opportunity to work in a well-established company, on platforms with global exposure and reach. You will make decisions on structure and style and your mark will be on everything that people interact with – your work will be seen by millions.
Specialise in frontend development with full stack awareness. The platforms you develop will be front and centre in the communication of our product and allow our user base to interact with us and each other. While you’re primarily concerned with frontend development, you’ll have full stack awareness that allows you to understand what is needed to make the final product possible.
Exercise your creativity and vision. You’ll utilise your technical skills and past experiences in creative and adaptive ways. It is crucial that you enjoy and seek out productive and iterative back and forth with our designers and feel enthusiastic about contributing your own vision and ideas.
Demonstrate leadership and ability to work across departments. Given the size of the team, there are opportunities for this role to morph into a more senior role as we grow and scale. Dependent on your interests and skill set, there will be room to move between web development and product development in relation to user interface design and implementation.
The skill set
A mindset and eye for design. Your success will depend on your ability to bring the ideas and concepts of our designers to life. An understanding of basic design principles will help you have the conversations that are needed to take a concept through to execution. We are searching for those developers with a keen eye for design who approach their craft with a playful curiosity.
Experience leading projects as a frontend developer. You have honed your craft in Frontend development with experience leading or taking significant responsibility for the execution of large-scale projects. An ability to change gears between giving and receiving feedback will set you up for success in our engineering environment.
Familiarity with fit-for-purpose technologies. You're more than capable with JavaScript and CSS and will have worked with Vue.js and/or React. You will have an aptitude for exploring new technologies and ideally have some experience with Typescript. A large part of your responsibility will also be to work closely with our backend engineers to tie the project together. Your understanding of current backend technologies and frameworks will ensure smooth collaboration.
Ability to work independently and collaboratively. You'll work across departments on multiple projects which require input from creatives and developers. You'll be as comfortable talking and working with other developers as you're having a conversation with a graphic designer or other creative. You’ll also need to be comfortable executing your individual tasks and responsibilities.
Methodical and process driven with a perfectionist mentality. Your work will require the ability to see detail and to meticulously reiterate designs and interfaces to ensure the highest levels of quality and user experience. This is a role for the developer who is constantly seeking out ways to refine and optimise whatever they are working on – close enough is never good enough for you.
in 1-3 months, you will...
Complete our onboarding process and become familiar with your colleagues, our workplace culture and tech stack.
Begin working alongside our Web Designer, Frontend Developers, and Head of Web to develop styles and structure for Folio and marketplace projects.
in 3 - 6 months, you will...
Start to finesse the designs and styles as prototypes to make sure that interactions work as desired and that we're delivering delightful and intuitive experiences.
Find and troubleshoot any design problems or pain points.
Make prototypes to reiterate, test and refine any of those issues and go live with your first major project.
in 6 - 12 months, you will...
Begin to improve and rework existing projects and be part of discussions around future roadmap.
Regularly contribute to the marketing and communication department by bringing design to life on a range of projects, releases, partnerships, and updates.
Maintain and ensure that our platforms continue to run smoothly and find and remove any bugs that arise.
We believe in cultivating a diverse and inclusive environment for all
Procreate values diversity in our workplace and community. Discrimination of any kind is unacceptable to us. Our diversity is our strength, and we are constantly working to improve our practices to make sure that we are representative of the society and world in which we live. In our interactions, we make every effort to ensure that all people are provided with the help they need to take part in the interview process, the performance of their work functions and the general enjoyment of their life at Procreate.

Invent Better – make a difference Technology is literally changing the world around us and yes, some people tend to focus on why that change is bad – it makes us uncomfortable; it breaks our status quo, it feeds our uncertainty – but at Orchard we choose to see it differently. Technology can make lives better. It can make businesses better, brands better and experiences better. It can be the change we want to see in the world.

Which is why we, at Orchard, rally around a single purpose: to invent better outcomes through creativity and technology. Those better outcomes can only exist in the context of people irrespective of if we label them users, customers, patients, clients or even staff.
