Company Profile
Akin is positioned at the intersection of data, creative design and contemporary culture, our unique approach to marketing delivers real business impact.
Job Description
An agency in its typical sense will have various teams – the planning, strategy and accounts team. As an agency, our developers will be expected to support these roles. As a web developer, you will be involved end-to-end from the planning process through project implementation and release.
 As a developer, you will need to be confident of your builds and how to approach development products. Business impact through integrated demand and lead generation is a big aspect of our work, so while you need to understand the mechanics and stay on top of it, you should also understand that a piece of strategic advice goes much further. In our agency, we believe in being agnostic of platforms or approaches e.g. you are comfortable in applying the principles of product management, innovation and digital transformation across different script, languages or technological platforms to achieve business goals. You’ll need to understand the client’s business and infrastructure, and at least be conversant in all aspects of a technology methodology which enables revenue generation or cost reduction. In our company, this will fall across our business pillars of insights, brand, marketing and technology. This will allow us to stay agile, sensible and rigorous in our recommendations.
In essence, you will be required to be experienced in all aspects of what commonly feeds towards strategy in a larger agency. You will need to be in charge of front-end development, working with project managers and account managers towards the success of the project. As you progress, you may be more knowledgeable or inclined towards one domain, but you should grasp the importance of others, and be able to understand and give advice on how it influences the outcomes you’re looking for. Within this, you’ll also be expected to understand how your work impacts the other departments.

 Job Description An agency in its typical sense will have various teams – the planning, strategy and accounts team. As an agency, our developers will be expected to support these roles. As a web developer, you will be involved end-to-end from the planning process through project implementation and release.
 As a developer, you will need to be confident of your builds and how to approach development products. Business impact through integrated demand and lead generation is a big aspect of our work, so while you need to understand the mechanics and stay on top of it, you should also understand that a piece of strategic advice goes much further. In our agency, we believe in being agnostic of platforms or approaches e.g. you are comfortable in applying the principles of product management, innovation and digital transformation across different script, languages or technological platforms to achieve business goals. You’ll need to understand the client’s business and infrastructure, and at least be conversant in all aspects of a technology methodology which enables revenue generation or cost reduction. In our company, this will fall across our business pillars of insights, brand, marketing and technology. This will allow us to stay agile, sensible and rigorous in our recommendations.
In essence, you will be required to be experienced in all aspects of what commonly feeds towards strategy in a larger agency. You will need to be in charge of front-end development, working with project managers and account managers towards the success of the project. As you progress, you may be more knowledgeable or inclined towards one domain, but you should grasp the importance of others, and be able to understand and give advice on how it influences the outcomes you’re looking for. Within this, you’ll also be expected to understand how your work impacts the other departments.

As a Software Developer in Titansoft, you can expect a monthly salary of SGD 5,000 to SGD 6,000
What a Software Developer does in Titansoft
Apply your expertise on our web applications using C#, ASP.NET and SQL
Integrate awesome web applications with database or API-driven back-ends
Design incredible templates for users' ease of use
Enjoy solving problems with your team before they even turn into one
Challenge ideas and spawn something revolutionary
Work in a dynamic, collaborative and non-hierarchical team to break new grounds
What we are looking for in a Software Developer
Experience
0 - 2 years of technical expertise in the software industry (fresh graduates definitely welcome!)
Knowledge and experience on industry best practices, such as Test-Driven Development and Clean Code
What makes a (Super!) Software Developer in Titansoft
Passionate about life and how to make it better through technology
Continuously seek improvements in our products, processes and people
Constantly honing programming techniques and developing new skills
What everyone gets in Titansoft (psst. We didn't get that Best Tech Company to Work for Award in 2017 for nothing!)
18 days of rest and relaxation for each year (P.S. It gets even better over the years!)
Competitive salaries and bonuses bench-marked against big players in the industry (Yeap, those companies!)
Flexible working hours (Sleep in a little longer after fixing that pesky bug from last night)
Comprehensive insurance coverage
Very well-stocked pantry (We've never heard of the term 'Hunger Games', nope)
Communities of Practice and Workshops catered for your growth and learning
Substantial subsidies and programs to keep that creative flow while having fun (Health promotion program, annual overseas company outing, an annual dinner that nobody will ever forget, etc.)
Hardcore work and hardcore fun!

EVYE is a Professional Branding Consultancy. We are Thinking Brands. We help businesses harness the power in a brand for good. All by Design.
Job Description
If you’re an aspiring designer who loves communicating brand emotion through user experiences, and keeping graphical elements consistent (with flourishes of creativity), then we want you! As design priorities shift towards interaction on screen, we are looking for a Web & Graphic designer to join us and push the quality of graphic design on the web.
We will gel with you if you enjoy:
Solving problems as a team using web, graphic design and UI/UX skills;
Presenting disparate information in neat and effective layouts;
Streamlining brand communications through powerful symbols and graphical elements;
Applying your design skills to help bring the broad concepts and ideas of others into reality; and
Enjoys contributing to and taking away from the marketplace of ideas at the creative workplace
The Scope:
Website Building (WordPress): Design, layout and front-end development (on WordPress) of on-brand websites based on key visuals, concepts and brand guidelines as directed by our Creative Director or Client.
Wireframing & Mockups: Design, illustrate and produce mock-up, wireframes, interactive UI/UX prototypes for client presentation and development.
Graphic Design: Support the creative team in creating, developing and designing graphical assets to support other on-brand collaterals (Brand guidelines, Social media posts, Digital banners, etc)
Maintenance & Technical Support: Support the creative team in maintaining and providing technical support for website whenever necessary.
Liaison works: Assist in communicating with third parties for website-related matters when required.
Don’t worry, you won’t need to be client-facing. So you can focus on doing the good work you do best. We’ll manage the clients.
What You Can Expect:
Supervision and Guidance: We will guide you along the way and develop your skills as a web builder, graphic designer and career professional. We are a team of creative consultants who have been through a lot, and walk the talk too.
Project Ownership: Once you’ve gained more experience, you’ll get the chance to independently develop your own and even take charge of certain projects.
Work with a team of in-house professionals: Need content? Need graphics? Animation? We can do it together as a team. This expands the possibilities of what we can create together.
Outcomes-driven working environment: Rather than focussing on just clocking hours, the proof is in the work delivered and professionalism. So, as long as good work gets done and done on time, we are more than happy to accommodate different working styles.
Long Term Career Goals: We invest quite a lot in our trainees, because we want to build a team that can grow with us, both professionally and holistically.
Apply with us if you are:
Intimately familiar with Adobe XD and front-end development, including using WordPress.
Technically skilled in the Adobe CS software (Photoshop, Illustrator minimum).
Experienced with the principles of good design and layout in the digital space.
Collaborative and communicative team player amongst fellow creative personalities.
Where we work:
Our office is at Launchpad@JTC in one-north. It’s where all the cool start-ups and creative people in Singapore are, and is right next to the one-north MRT station. We also adopt a flexible hybrid work schedule to balance our individual working styles and team collaboration work.

Alt Research is the company building and maintaining the AltLayer Network — an elastic scaling layer for all blockchains. AltLayer equips both EVM (e.g., Ethereum) and non-EVM chains (e.g., Polkadot) with an on-demand execution layer that can handle large surge in transaction processing requests. AltLayer enables dApp developers to quickly spin off a custom execution layer called flash layer to serve users, with near-instant finality (< 2s), low gas fees (< 0.01USD) and high throughput (~2,000 tps).

The project is being developed by blockchain veterans and award-winning researchers, who have previously held key roles at Parity, Zilliqa and Synthetix.

Role
We are looking for top talents to join our fast-growing team to build a scalable future for blockchains. We are currently looking for a self-driven and experienced Smart Contract Developer (Solidity) to develop our flash layer solution for dApp developers. You are expected to work closely with the core team members and deliver secure and reliable smart contracts running on any compatible EVM platform. Some full-stack development is also required for off-chain logics and/or to build user-friendly interfaces. We are based in Singapore but remote working is also acceptable.

This role is open for remote work for candidates located between UTC+2 and UTC+12 (most of the team is based in Asia, and you are expected to adjust your work schedule accordingly).

Responsibilities

Write thorough unit-tests.
Design/implement secure and reliable smart contracts in Solidity.
Static analysis and dynamic analysis of bytecode and source code.
Work with full stack developers to create full-fledged decentralized applications.
Collaborate with other team members to plan projects.
Perform design reviews and code reviews regularly.
Create technical specifications and documentation.

Requirements

Over 3 years of experience in smart contract and dApp development.
Knowledge and experience of Test-Driven Development.
Familiar with the common smart contract vulnerabilities.
Experience of smart contract development framework such as Hardhat or Truffle.
Experience in full-stack web development with Typescript, Node.js and Go. Rust is a plus.
Familiarity with open-source development and collaborations.
Strong problem-solving and communication skills.

Benefits

Competitive base compensation with performance-based incentives.
Highly fulfilling and mission-driven culture.
Fast career path.
Flexible working hours.
